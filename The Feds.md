## Creating money
Banks act as a bridge between savers and borrowers. A bank's ability to make loans (*to create money*) is limited to a certain percentage to its customer deposits.

Banks must hold a percentage of their total deposits as **reserves**.
- **Reserve ratio**: level of reserve a bank holds as a percentage of total deposits
- **Reserve requirement**: minimum required level of reserves a bank must hold as cash, or a fed deposit.

**Fractional reserve banking system**: when bank receives a deposit, a portion of it is held in reserve. The rest is lent out, which begins money creation. Banks create money by **lending excess reserves.** 

Suppose $1000 is deposit in bank A, and deposit requirement is 20%. Then, the balance sheet (T-account) looks like the following:

Suppose that the $800 that is lent out ends up in another bank, and that bank will then lend out 80%.
