## Definition
Is anything that is accepted in exchange for other goods and services; or for the payment of debt. For a commodity to be used as money: 
- its **value** must be **easy** to **determine**
- must be **divisible**
- must be **durable**
- must be **widely accepted**

### Fiat money
Does not have intrinsic value (unlike gold) but is accepted as money by government

### Functions
- A **medium of exchange**: goods and services are exchanged for money
- A **unit of account**: money is used to compare values of a wide variety of goods and services
- A **store of value**: can be saved and used for future purchases

Since the alternative of money is **barter**, it is much more complicated because it needs a **double coincidence** (equivalent exchange) to occur. It is mainly used in primitive economies. 

## Liquidity
An asset's liquidity is determined by how fast, easily, and reliably it can be **converted into cash.**
- Money is highly liquid, because it can be used immediately to purchases G&S
- Stocks, bonds, and precious metals are **less liquid** because they have to be converted to money before they can be spent.
- Houses and other physical assets are **least liquid**, because they require more effort to convert to money.
