## Definition
Is anything that is accepted in exchange for other goods and services; or for the payment of debt. For a commodity to be used as money: 
- its **value** must be **easy** to **determine**
- must be **divisible**
- must be **durable**
- must be **widely accepted**

### Fiat money
Does not have intrinsic value (unlike gold) but is accepted as money by government

### Functions
- A **medium of exchange**: goods and services are exchanged for money
- A **unit of account**: money is used to compare values of a wide variety of goods and services
- A **store of value**: can be saved and used for future purchases

Since the alternative of money is **barter**, it is much more complicated because it needs a **double coincidence** (equivalent exchange) to occur. It is mainly used in primitive economies. 

## Liquidity
An asset's liquidity is determined by how fast, easily, and reliably it can be **converted into cash.**
- Money is highly liquid, because it can be used immediately to purchases G&S
- Stocks, bonds, and precious metals are **less liquid** because they have to be converted to money before they can be spent.
- Houses and other physical assets are **least liquid**, because they require more effort to convert to money.

## The money supply
The Federal Reserve (Fed) uses 2 primary measures of the money supply: M1, and M2.
- M1 = currency in circulation (bills + coins) + checkable deposits. The most liquid kind of money.
	- The total value of this money supply is roughly $3.7 trillion. **Currency** constitutes **half** of M1, where banknotes take up 90%. The other half is made up of **checking accounts.**
- M2 is a **broader** supply of money. It includes all of M1 and near monies: 
	- Saving deposits
	- Money market deposits
	- Small-value time deposits
	- Money market mutual funds

## Market for loanable funds
- Why do people save? $\rightarrow$ save = supply
	- The reward for saving is the interest rate. 
	- The supply of loanable funds is **positively** related to the interest rate.
- Why do people borrow? $\rightarrow$ borrow = demand
	- To buy goods and services, or to invest in capital
	- The demand for loanable funds is **negatively** related to the interest rate.

E.g. a theme park purchasing capital, such as a new roller coaster, often relies on the market for loanable funds.

The equilibrium interest rate is determined by borrowers (demand) and lenders (supply).
