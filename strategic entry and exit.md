entry and exits are **long run** decisions.

when a firm enters the market:
- the price set by the incumbent firm will go down, leading to lower profit
- quantity sold by the incumbent firm will go down

three main types of entry:
- de novo entry: a firm that has never been in the same market before (brand new firms). generally small firms, and tend not to be successful (i.e. Rivian in the car market)
- diversified entry: entry via new products (because a firm has created a product competitive to ours)
- geographic market entry: firms that originally start outside our market, but geographically enters into ours.

if enter: have to obtain capital to last the 10 year gap, or find a way to.
- risk: unknown, but predictable. we are able to describe the probabilities of some of the outcomes.
- uncertainty: we know **nothing**, and we can predict nothing. 
most of the time, firms have subjective probabilities - instead of not having anything at all.

a decision maker's tolerance is their choice to treat two different gambles.
- risk-averse if you choose to take the less risky option, given that both have equal expected values.
- risk-loving if we choose the more risky option.
- risk-neutral if you don't really care (indifferent) about which one, if they have the same expected value. for a risk-neutral decision maker, **only the expected value matters**.

we typically assume that a decision maker is risk-neutral, meaning they will always go for whichever decision yields the higher expected value.

it needs to be the case that our rival needs to **believe** that our strategy is permanent.

for example, before a new firm enters, you would want to expand your output capacity, which shows entering firms that the incumbent firms already have the massive capacity to expand.

a. the incumbent firms need to have either a cost advantage, or a revenue advantage (network externalities, consumer lock in). there also needs to be a case where the entering firm can't quickly overcome the asymmetry either.

the only way that the entering firm can overcome this asymmetry is entering on a large scale, and incurring a huge setup cost, **which are all sunk**. if these costs don't exist, then there are no barriers to entry/exit.

- scale economies - entering on a cost disadvantage
- scope economies -

### limit pricing
limit pricing is a strategy to **prevent entry**. it is usually cheaper to deter entry than to force a firm to exit later. so, limit pricing is **lowering your price** before a firm enters. you can still some economic profit, but *not maximum* profit. 

limit pricing is lower than the profit-maximizing price, but still higher than costs. because the original price is high enough, to the entering firm, a little cut due to price reduction is still good enough for economic profit. so, you can just limit price until the future stream of profit is small enough so that the cost can't be covered by the entering firm. 
### asymmetric situation 1: cost advantages
let's say Star Coffee is currently selling coffee at 4 bucks a cup. suppose that another firm, Burnt Beans, wants to open in the same mall, and compete with Star. 

Star believes that 3 dollars is the limit pricing, but she needs to commit to this price for a whole year. for example, Star asks the owner of the mall to create a contract that says "do not change price for the whole year", and tapes it to the wall for the owner of Burnt Beans to see.

the characteristics of limit pricing:
- higher than the incumbent firms' LRATC
- low enough so that the entering firms would have negative profit (profit cannot cover cost of entry)

if an incumbent firm **could** change their price after another firm enters, **they would**. note that the Nash price in the duopoly is higher than the limit price, so the incumbent firm could unilaterally change their prices and make more profit. 

limit pricing can only work if the incumbent firm can convince the entering firm that they can commit to charging the limit price post-entry.
### asymmetric situation 2: signaling theory
the entering firm might think that we have achieved some sort of cost breakthrough, so they would expect to enter at a cost disadvantage. so, the limit pricing **can** work. 

b. 
he concludes that cement producers effectively created a cartel, which means they are able to set prices much higher than MC. these firms could ship their cement to rivals' areas to compete if they wanted to, but they don't.

usually, when demand increases, the cartel price also increases. however, in this case, demand goes up, but cartel prices still stay the same! more evidence they are engaging in limit pricing.

### predatory pricing
a force exit strategy. usually consists of 2 phases:
1. predation: the predator (firm that executes this strategy) cuts their price below their LAC. the predator would lose money in this phase.
2. recoupment: predator bumps price up again

the discussion in this case, is going to be how much we will lose in phase 1, and how much we can regain in phase 2.
