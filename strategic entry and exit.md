entry and exits are **long run** decisions.

when a firm enters the market:
- the price set by the incumbent firm will go down, leading to lower profit
- quantity sold by the incumbent firm will go down

three main types of entry:
- de novo entry: a firm that has never been in the same market before (brand new firms). generally small firms, and tend not to be successful (i.e. Rivian in the car market)
- diversified entry: entry via new products (because a firm has created a product competitive to ours)
- geographic market entry: firms that originally start outside our market, but geographically enters into ours.

if enter: have to obtain capital to last the 10 year gap, or find a way to.

- risk: unknown, but predictable. we are able to describe the probabilities of some of the outcomes.
- uncertainty: we know **nothing**, and we can predict nothing. 
most of the time, firms have subjective probabilities - instead of not having anything at all.

a decision maker's tolerance is their choice to treat two different gambles.
- risk-averse if you choose to take the less risky option, given that both have equal expected values.
- risk-loving if we choose the more risky option.
- risk-neutral if you don't really care (indifferent) about which one, if they have the same expected value. for a risk-neutral decision maker, **only the expected value matters**.

we typically assume that a decision maker is risk-neutral, meaning they will always go for whichever decision yields the higher expected value.
