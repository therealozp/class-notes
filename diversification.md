diversification is a horizontal decision. 
#### q11: why diversify
- leads to increase in profit due to some efficiency reason (economies of scope), either through increasing revenue or reducing costs
- the principle-agent problem: when there owners of the firms are different from the managers of the firm. (separation between ownership and management)
	- misaligned incentives, and owners are unable to determine if mangers are making bad decisions

#### q12
first profit-based reason for diversification is **complementarities**. 
- can add to revenue
- or reduce costs
- or both

three possibilities:
- economies of scope (cost complementarity)
- revenue complementarity: firm has product variety, aiming at shared consumer groups (for example, via umbrella branding)
- dominant general management logic:
	- will works well if there is a particular skillset that allows them to be very profitable in multiple different field
	- this logic is **not** widely thought to be successful. case in point, Disney. 
	- (rarely there's gonna be a Steve Jobs who smurfs on everyone)

#### q13
a. 
they have profitable investments, like R&D, advertising, expanding to multiple different geographic regions. they move cash from cash-rich divisions to more cash-constrained divisions.

if there is no internal capital markets, externals are fine as well - as long as you can convince other financial institutions that this is profitable.

b.
- **asymmetric information**: where the firm knows more about the **profit potential** than the lender. (lender suspicious of firms might be lying)
- **debt**: lenders might be reluctant to lend if they see funds have too much debt.
- **monitoring costs**: if they are costly, lenders might not be willing to lend.
#### q14
"buying undervalued firms will increase the value of current firm" - bad CEOs
- **the winner's curse**: if a big firm bid a certain value, other opponents come in and bid it up (so it's not undervalued anymore). so, if you're the winner, other bidders don't think that they are worth that much money
- good CEOs are already busy focusing on their own product, instead of searching out for other companies. 
- antitrust approval, 
#### q15
a. 
managers undertake mergers knowing that they can reduce a firm's value - but they don't care:
- managers like to manage big firms (ego)
- CEOs compensation might be directly tied to number of employees, growth rate, etc. by engaging in these acquisitions and mergers

b. 
- if the board of directors are hired directly by the CEO, and not from external directors. in fact, higher external directors are a good indicator of a well-managed company
- the principle-agent problem, where owners don't have exact information of what their managers are doing.
#### q16
in the public market, the company is always going to be a target for a takeover. when a company is poorly run, it becomes undervalued. once a company is bought, if the buyer thinks you're doing a bad job, you will get replaced - hence **corporate control**.
