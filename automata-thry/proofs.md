## proof by contradiction
e.g. suppose $x$ is rational and $y$ is irrational, prove that $x + y$ is irrational. 

> Suppose $x + y$ is rational. 
> Then, $x + y - x$ should also be rational, hence $y$ is rational. (False statement). 
> So, $x + y$ must be irrational. 

More formally: 

> Suppose that $x + y$ is rational, that is, it takes the form $\frac{a}{b}$, and $x$ has the form $\frac{c}{d}$
> Then, the subtraction $x + y - x$ would produce value $\frac{ad - bc}{bd}$, meaning that it $y$ is rational
> But it isn't 
> So $x + y$ is irrational.

essentially, start with the supposition, and work your way back up to prove a particular statement false.
