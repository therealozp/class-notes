the first assumption to do game theory is that both firms have **common knowledge**. this may or may not be true, as there are also situations where they are dealing with **asymmetric knowledge**. 

in this way, asymmetric knowledge changes the way the game is played.

## rules
1. if you have a dominant strategy, play it. in this case, the dominant strategy will always be whichever **one maximizes your own profit.**
2. assume the rival is strategically astute. meaning, if they also have a dominant strategy, they **will** play it.

if one of you have a dominant strategy (and know about your rivals'), the game is basically solved.

1. mark best decisions first. always mark everything, and show process. for each dominant payoff cell for each rival, mark which choice they will make.
