In a boolean equation system, we can get the duality of whatever the current Boolean equation is by changing all + to $\cdot$ , all 0's to 1's, and keep the variables intact. For example, the duality of the boolean equation $a(b + c)$ will be $a + bc$. Similar to DeMorgan's, without the negation.

The principle of duality states that if a statement $F_{1}= F_{2}$, then the dual of both statements $D$ will also be true $D(F_{1)} = D(F_{2})$.
