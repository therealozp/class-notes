Good work! Personally, I would elaborate more on the weightings and why those are important to your product. Try to cut back on the empty lines because you have a lot of wasted space. I would also elaborate more on the impact of the heuristic cards or whatever you choose. 

Also, please make the tables and figures centered on the screen. Just formatting issues needing to be taken care of. 

This looks really good! Everything is in place, but I feel like it is a bit too compressed. Maybe try a little bit more spacing? Also, try to discuss more on what impacted the final project (heuristic cards, etc.) because I don't see anything of the sort here. 

Your appendix looks really nice, but try to have the entire team submit the same appendix. It's how it's supposed to be!

Fantastic work! Be sure to follow up with the guidelines to be consistent on text fonts and sizes. Also elaborate on how the heuristic cards and other factors impacted the decision of your team.

Your memo is missing the initial paragraph of comparing and contrasting the two models. Be sure to have that for the final one. I would also look into how the heuristic cards impacted your team's final decision.

First, you should NOT put "Opening: ", "Middle: " or anything of the sort. Think an email. It should be like that. Also, your memo section is formatted wrong so be sure to check up on that. I would also add some more explanations why something has so-and-so ratings. Also, keep it to ONLY 1 page. 

Be sure to have your teammates reformat the tables in the Appendix, their sizes should be consistent, and should have a descriptive label.

Also, your memo section is lacking some information regarding the engineering specifications. I would also add some more explanations to the middle section why something has so-and-so ratings. Also, discuss what the impact heuristic cards made on your final decision.

You have a LOT of empty space between your paragraphs. Fill that up with information, or use a 1.5 spacing instead. Also consider adding the impact of the heuristic cards on your final model.  

Also make sure that your appendix page does not have empty lines on the top. Ensure that everyone in your group submits the same appendix page.

Your memo should not have first-line indents like that. For your first paragraph, please compare and contrast between the two models, comparing the differences. For your middle section, write everything in bullet points, not separate paragraphs. Also refer to the memo guidelines for more information.

Your first paragraph should be a paragraph, not separate lines of text. Your appendix should be on another page.
