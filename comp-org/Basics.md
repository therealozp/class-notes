## 1. Organization vs architecture
- Organization: all **physical aspects** of systems (e.g. circuits, signals, memory types, etc. )
- Architecture: **logical, abstract system** implementation as seen by a programmer (e.g. instruction sets, formats, dtypes, mem access methos, I/O, etc.) 
In reality, there is no clear distinction between problems of the two:

> **any task done by software can be accomplished by hardware (and vice versa)**
#### a. Components
At the most basic level, a computer consists of three pieces: 
- **Processor** to interpret and process programs
- **Memory** to store data & programs
- A mechanism for **I/O**

#### b. ??? Cores ???
The principle of multi-core CPUs stem from **parallelism**, which makes computers go brrr
