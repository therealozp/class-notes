## strategic entry/exit dq3

a. the incumbent firms need to have either a cost advantage, or a revenue advantage (network externalities, consumer lock in). there also needs to be a case where the entering firm can't quickly overcome the asymmetry either.

the only way that the entering firm can overcome this asymmetry is entering on a large scale, and incurring a huge setup cost, **which are all sunk**. if these costs don't exist, then there are no barriers to entry/exit.

b.
- scale economies - entering on a cost disadvantage
- scope economies - 

## limit pricing
limit pricing is a strategy to **prevent entry**. it is usually cheaper to deter entry than to force a firm to exit later. so, limit pricing is **lowering your price** before a firm enters. you can still some economic profit, but *not maximum* profit. 

limit pricing is lower than the profit-maximizing price, but still higher than costs. because the original price is high enough, to the entering firm, a little cut due to price reduction is still good enough for economic profit. so, you can just limit price until the future stream of profit is small enough so that the cost can't be covered by the entering firm. 

the entering firm might think that we have achieved some sort of cost breakthrough, so they won't enter. 

let's say Star Coffee is currently selling coffee at 4 bucks a cup. suppose that another firm, Burnt Beans, wants to open in the same mall, and compete with Star. 

Star believes that 3 dollars is the limit pricing, but she needs to commit to this price for a whole year. for example, Star asks the owner of the mall to create a contract that says "do not change price for the whole year", and tapes it to the wall for the owner of Burnt Beans to see.
