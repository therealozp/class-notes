A thin lens is a transparent and **slightly-curved** refractor. There are two particular lens to consider: 

## Converging
The optical axis runs right through the lens:

All distances are with respect with the lens: 
- Object distance: $p$
- Image distance: $q$
- Focal length: $f$
- Object height: $h$
- Image height: $h'$ 

For each object distance $p$, if: 
- $p > f$: the lens produces a **real** image

- $p < f$: lens will produce a **virtual image** behind the object.

### Some helpful equations: 
To get the magnification $M$:
$$M = \frac{h'}{h}$$
The thin lens equation that relates $p, q$ and $f$: 
$$\frac{1}{d_0} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}$$
This equation can be established by doing a series of tangents on equivalent angles and relating them together, taking the sign convention as negative pointing down.

## Sign convention
The sign conventions for the given quantities in the lens equation and magnification equations are as follows:

- $f$ is **+** if the lens is a double convex lens (**converging** lens)
- $f$ is **-** if the lens is a double concave lens (**diverging** lens)

- $d_i$ is **+** if the image is a **real image** and located on the **opposite side of the lens**.
- $d_i$ is **-** if the image is a **virtual** image and located on the **object's side** of the lens.

- $h_i$ is **+** if the image is an **upright** image (and therefore, also **virtual**)
- $h_i$ is **-** if the image an **inverted** image (and therefore, also **real**)
