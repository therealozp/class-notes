A thin lens is a transparent and **slightly-curved** refractor. There are two particular lens to consider: 

## Converging
The optical axis runs right through the lens:

All distances are with respect with the lens: 
- Object distance: $p$
- Image distance: $q$
- Focal length: $f$
- Object height: $h$
- Image height: $h'$ 

For each object distance $p$, if: 
- $p > f$: the lens produces a **real** image

- $p < f$: lens will produce a **virtual image** behind the object.

### Some helpful equations: 
To get the magnification $M$:
$$M = \frac{h'}{h}$$
The thin lens equation that relates $p, q$ and $f$: 
$$\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{f}$$
This equation can be established by doing a series of tangents on equivalent angles and relating them together, taking the sign convention as negative pointing down.
