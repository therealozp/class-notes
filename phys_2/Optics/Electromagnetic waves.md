James Maxwell postulated that, if an electric field can be induced using magnetic fields, then the opposite should also be possible. 
- A change in either field generated the existence of the other, and the co-existed **perpendicular** to each other,
- These fields oscillate harmoniously and self-sustainingly together as an **electromagnetic wave.**
- Light is an EM wave whose speed is simply $3.0 \times 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$.

An EM waves can be generated by using an RLC resonator circuit coupled with a transformer. This will create an oscillating charge, that will generate an **alternating electric field**, which then induces **a magnetic field**.

### The spectrum

As frequencies increase, wavelengths decreases: 
$$c = \lambda f$$
It caries energy in all parts of the spectrum: 
$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
For an EM wave, the rate for which energy is transported by the EM wave is given by the magnitude of the Poynting vector, and **must be in the direction of the wave.**:
$$\vec S = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec E \times \vec B $$
Then, the magnitude will simply be: 
$$S = \frac{1}{\mu_0}EB\sin{\theta} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}EB  $$
because E and B are perpendicular to each other. Here, $E$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of fields at an **instant in time.** This is because the wave is sinusoidal, and since it changes, the Poynting vector will change as well.

In these equations, $B_0$ is the **maximum magnetic field**, and $E_0$ is the maximum **electric** field.
$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The maximum field is related by: 
$$B_0= cE_0$$
where $c= \lambda f$. 

The Poynting vector has units of $\frac{W}{m^2}$, which are the same units as intensity. To get the average intensity, we time-average the Poynting vector: 
$$\overline{I} = \frac{1}{2\mu_0}E_0B_0$$
Applying the above equations, we get the equation: 
$$\overline I = \frac{E_0^2}{2c\mu_0}=c\epsilon_0E_{rms}^2$$

The energy density in the delivered by the wave is therefore: 
$$\overline u = \frac{E_0^2\epsilon_0}{2}=\epsilon_0E_{rms}^2$$
So, the **average power delivered to the area element** is: 
$$\overline P = \overline IA = \epsilon_0E_{rms}^2A$$
