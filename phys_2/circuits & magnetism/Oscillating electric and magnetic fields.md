## Magnetic Flux
Through a conducting loop, magnetic flux through a conducting loop is: 
$$\Phi = BA$$

## Faraday's Law

- A current (thus voltage) was measured when the magnet was either moving towards or away from the loop. 
- The polarity is different if the magnet was moving towards or away from the loop
- There is no current when the magnet remains static.

Due to the change in flux through a loop, an emf is induced such that the loop now has a current through it.
$$\epsilon=\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$
According to the first point in the summary, the "induced" emf is not merely due to a change in flux, but due to a **rate of change** in flux. For a system of $N$ windings, the emf is as follows; 
$$\epsilon=N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$
## Lenz's Law
The **induced emf** due to the change in flux through a closed loop is **an opposition emf** set up to oppose **the change of flux**, and thus the mechanism for which caused the change in flux.

So, when the bar magnet approached the loop, we read a current with an opposite polarity as when the magnet was retracted. In other words, it **opposed** the *increase* in flux with one polarity, thus reversed polarity when the **induced emf** was set up to oppose the *decrease* in flux.

## Transformers

When there is an alternating current $V_P = V_o \cdot \cos{\omega t}$: 
- the oscillating electric field will generate **a change in flux** through the primary coil
- the flux is transported through the iron core to the secondary
- **an induced emf** is now generated across the secondary coil (blue)

According to [[#Faraday's Law]]: 
$$\begin{split}
V_P&=N_P\frac{\Delta\Phi_P}{\Delta t} \\
V_S&=N_S\frac{\Delta\Phi_S}{\Delta t} \\\\
\frac{\Delta\Phi_P}{\Delta t} &=\frac{\Delta\Phi_S}{\Delta t} \ (conserved \ flux \ lines)
\end{split}
$$
For an ideal transformer: 
1. Flux lines are preserved
2. Power is preserved.

Since the flux is the same, we can rearrange the equation we can get: 
$$\frac{V_P}{V_S} = \frac{N_P}{N_S}$$
If $N_S > N_P$, then it is a step-up transformer. Else, it's a step down transformer.

From law number 2 stating the equivalence in power, we can also get the equation: 
$$I_P V_P = I_SV_S$$

## Electromagnetic waves
James Maxwell postulated that, if an electric field can be induced using magnetic fields, then the opposite should also be possible. 
- A change in either field generated the existence of the other, and the co-existed **perpendicular** to each other,
- These fields oscillate harmoniously and self-sustainingly together as an **electromagnetic wave.**
- Light is an EM wave whose speed is simply $3.0 \times 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$.

An EM waves can be generated by using an RLC resonator circuit coupled with a transformer. This will create an oscillating charge, that will generate an **alternating electric field**, which then induces **a magnetic field**.

### The spectrum

![[Pasted image 20231106212034.png]]

As frequencies increase, wavelengths decreases: 
$$c = \lambda f$$
It caries energy in all parts of the spectrum: 
$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
For an EM wave, the rate for which energy is transported by the EM wave is given by the magnitude of the Poynting vector, and **must be in the direction of the wave.**:
$$\vec S = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec E \times \vec B $$
Then, the magnitude will simply be: 
$$S = \frac{1}{\mu_0}EB\sin{\theta} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}EB  $$
because E and B are perpendicular to each other. Here, $E$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of fields at an **instant in time.** This is because the wave is sinusoidal, and since it changes, the Poynting vector will change as well.

In these equations, $B_0$ is the **maximum magnetic field**, and $E_0$ is the maximum **electric** field.
$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The maximum field is related by: 
$$B_0= cE_0$$
where $c= \lambda f$. 

The Poynting vector has units of $\frac{W}{m^2}$, which are the same units as intensity. To get the average intensity, we time-average the Poynting vector: 
$$\overline{I} = \frac{1}{2\mu_0}E_0B_0$$
Applying the above equations, we get the equation: 
$$\overline I = \frac{E_0^2}{2c\mu_0}=c\epsilon_0E_{rms}^2$$

The energy density in the delivered by the wave is therefore: 
$$\overline u = \frac{E_0^2\epsilon_0}{2}=\epsilon_0E_{rms}^2$$
So, the **average power delivered to the area element** is: 
$$\overline P = \overline IA = \epsilon_0E_{rms}^2A$$
