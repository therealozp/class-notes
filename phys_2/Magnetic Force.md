## On moving charges
Consider a charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\vec v(x, y)$ in a magnetic field $\vec B(x, y)$. It is observed that a force **perpendicular** to **both** $\vec v$ and $\vec B$ and deflects the moving charge from its trajectory.

The unit for magnetic force is one *Tesla*. The **magnitude** of the force is determined to depend on: 
$$|F_m| \propto q, B, v \ and \ \theta$$
Since the force depends on these quantities and is always perpendicular to the other two vectors, the equation of a magnetic force on a moving charge is defined as: 
$$\vec F_m = q\vec v \times \vec B$$
The cross product yields a vector that is perpendicular to the other two. The magnitude of the cross product can be written as: 
$$|F_m| = qvB\sin{\theta}$$
Note that when $\theta$ is 0 or 180, the magnitude is zero. For the case when $\theta = 90\degree$, $F_m$ is at a **maximum**.

When calculating the effect of **two charges** on each other, we evaluate it normally, first by computing $\vec B$ then substituting it into the equation above. Remember to take into consideration the directions. The formula for calculating the **magnitude** $B$-force of a charge without being provided $\vec B$: 
$$F=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q^2v^2}{r^2}$$
To determine the direction of *deflection*, we use the right hand rule: 

>Place your **fingers** in the direction of the **field**, **thumb** in the direction of the **velocity**, and your **palm normal** is the direction of the **force**.

At every instant, the magnetic force is deflecting the particle, and if it is constantly occurring, it defines a **circular** motion.

The velocity is always tangent to the circular path, and the magnetic force is always a **center-seeking force**.
$$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow qB = \frac{mv}{r}$$
Since $$v = \frac{2\pi r}{t} = \omega r$$we have: 
$$\omega = \frac{qB}{m}$$
This is called the **cyclotron frequency.**

*We would also get the same result for a negative charge, but the only difference is the charge will be in an **opposite** direction.* So for example, if the positive charge traces **counterclockwise**, a negative one traces **clockwise.**

## On current-carrying wires
Let's assume we have a current-carrying wire in the presence of magnetic field that is perpendicular to the current element (everywhere in space)

![[Pasted image 20231003132351.png]]

Consider a charge element $q$ moving through a wire segment $L$ with a drift speed $v$ in a time of $\Delta t$.
$$I = \frac{q}{\Delta t} = \frac{q}{\frac{L}{v}} = \frac{qv}{L} \rightarrow qv = IL$$
Thus, for a current-carrying wire segment: 
$$F_m = ILB\sin{\theta}$$
The angle $\theta$ represents the angle between the current element and the magnetic field. So, the max is at $\theta = 90\degree$. 

To find the direction, use the same right hand rule. 

> Point your fingers in the direction of the field, thumb in direction of current, and palm normal is the direction of force.

For the same line of problems, to find the **magnetic field** generated by a current-carrying wire, we can use the same right hand rule: 

> Point your thumb in the direction of the current, and curl the other fingers. The **tangential vector** is the direction of the field at that point.

Consider the following example, where we have two parallel current elements asserting a force on each other: 
![[Pasted image 20231003133023.png]] 
So, let $d$ be the separation between the two wires. To calculate this force ($F_{1\ on\ 2}$), we must first calculate the **magnetic field** $B_1$, based on [[Biot-Savart & Ampere's Law]]: 
$$B_1 = \frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}$$
Substituting that value into the formula to calculate $F$, we get the following equation:
$$F_{1, 2} = I_2L_2B_1 = I_2L_2\frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}$$
To determine the direction, we use the right-hand rule, as always. In this case, the force is **attractive** when these two currents are going in the **same direction**. Flip one around, and they become **repulsive.**

## Torque on a current loop
Consider a square loop of wire with a current $I$ in a magnetic field coming out of the page. 

![[Pasted image 20231003163812.png]]

There is only a force on the wires on the top and bottom. The sides are parallel to the field. Now, rotate the loop so that the top segment aims out of the page: 

![[Pasted image 20231003163928.png]]

Right-hand-rule dictates that tilting the loop also means the magnetic force on the top wire points up, which creates a torque. We have: 
$$
\begin{split}
\tau & = rF_\perp \\
F_\perp &=ILB \\
r &=\frac{L}{2}
\end{split}
$$
Since there are 2 wire segments, we add up the segments in the field that have a force on it. Thus: 
$$
\tau = \frac{L}{2}ILB + \frac{L}{2}ILB = IL^2B = \mu \cdot B
$$
Here, $\mu = IA$ (the dipole moment).

A more general form of this equation would be 
$$\tau=IAB\sin\phi$$
where $\phi$ is the angle between the field and the plane normal.
## Potential Energy
With some magic through connecting the effects of the electric field, we can deduce the value of the potential energy for a **magnetic dipole** in the **magnetic field** is: 
$$U = -\vec \mu \cdot \vec B = -\mu B \cos\phi$$
where $\phi$ is the angle between $\vec \mu$ and $\vec B$.
## Magnetic domains
Within a magnetic material, there are magnetic domains. Originally, they are randomly oriented, but an magnetic force can be applied to align the domains.

## Mass spectrometry
Consider a charge $q$ moving through a velocity $\vec v$ in a m-field $\vec B$. [[#On moving charges]]

The ion is accelerated by a potential difference, then enters a chamber and deflected by the constant magnetic field. Like this, the mass of the ion can be determined.

Recall: 
$$\Delta KE = -\Delta PE = q_0\Delta V$$
And the mass function: 
$$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow m = \frac{rqB}{v}$$
From this, we can solve for the mass of the ion and anything in between. A particularly useful formula to get the radius of orbit: 
$$r=\frac{mv}{qB}$$

Pretty unimportant stuff here.
