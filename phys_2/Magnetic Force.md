## On moving charges
Consider a charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\vec v(x, y)$ in a magnetic field $\vec B(x, y)$. It is observed that a force **perpendicular** to **both** $\vec v$ and $\vec B$ and deflects the moving charge from its trajectory.

The unit for magnetic force is one *Tesla*. The **magnitude** of the force is determined to depend on: 
$$|F_m| \propto q, B, v \ and \ \theta$$
Since the force depends on these quantities and is always perpendicular to the other two vectors, the equation of a magnetic force on a moving charge is defined as: 
$$\vec F_m = q\vec v \times \vec B$$
The cross product yields a vector that is perpendicular to the other two. The magnitude of the cross product can be written as: 
$$|F_m| = qvB\sin{\theta}$$
Note that when $\theta$ is 0 or 180, the magnitude is zero. For the case when $\theta = 90\degree$, $F_m$ is at a **maximum**. 

To determine the direction of *deflection*, we use the right hand rule: 

>Place your **fingers** in the direction of the **field**, **thumb** in the direction of the **velocity**, and your **palm normal** is the direction of the **force**.

At every instant, the magnetic force is deflecting the particle, and if it is constantly occurring, it defines a **circular** motion.

The velocity is always tangent to the circular path, and the magnetic force is always a **center-seeking force**.
$$qvb = \frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow qB = \frac{mv}{r}$$
Since $v = \frac{2\pi r}{t} = \omega r$, we have: 
$$\omega = \frac{qB}{m}$$
This is called the **cyclotron frequency.**

*We would also get the same result for a negative charge, but the only difference is the charge will be in an **opposite** direction.* So for example, if the positive charge traces **counterclockwise**, a negative one traces **clockwise.**

## On current-carrying wires
Let's assume we have a current-carrying wire in the presence of magnetic field that is perpendicular to the current element (everywhere in space)

Consider a charge element $q$ moving through a wire segment $L$ with a drift speed $v$ in a time of $\Delta t$.
$$I = \frac{q}{\Delta t} = \frac{q}{\frac{L}{v}} = \frac{qv}{L} \rightarrow qv = IL$$
Thus, for a current-carrying wire segment: 
$$F_m = ILB\sin{\theta}$$
The angle $\theta$ represents the angle between the current element and the magnetic field. So, the max is at $\theta = 90\degree$. 

To find the direction, use the same right hand rule. 

> Point your fingers in the direction of the field, thumb in direction of current, and palm normal is the direction of force.

The field generated by a current-carrying wire can be found using Ampere's law. 
$$B_{wire} = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$$
where $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \ T\cdot \frac{m}{A}$. Consider the example: 
![[Pasted image 20231003133023.png]] 
So, let $d$ be the separation between the two wires. We could get the equation: 
$$F_{1, 2} = I_2L_2B_1 = I_2L_2B\frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}$$
The force is **attractive** when these two currents are going in the **same direction**. Flip one around, and they become **repulsive.**
