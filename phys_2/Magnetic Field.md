## The bar magnet
- Has a North pole and a South pole, and magnetic field lines travel **from North to South**
- The field is **non-uniform**
- Direction of the magnetic field at any point is **tangential** to the field lines
- This is a **dipole**, meaning it ALWAYS have a N-S pole.

## Interactions with the current
It was discovered that a current-carrying wire will also have a magnetic field. As the current increases, the magnetic field also increases in proportion. 
- Obeys the **right hand rule**

### Solenoid
- Tightly-wrapped conducting wire, where length > diameter.
- $n$ of wraps go up to 15000
- A **uniform** field around the center

Inserting an object with a *ferro* core into it, we get an **electromagnet.** This increases the magnetic field even more. In all cases, the magnetic field is always **directly proportional** to $I$: 
$$B \propto I$$
For a solenoid, it will also be directly proportional to $n$, the number of coils: 
$$B\propto n$$
