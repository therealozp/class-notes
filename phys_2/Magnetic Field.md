## The bar magnet
- Has a North pole and a South pole, and magnetic field lines travel **from North to South**
- The field is **non-uniform**
- Direction of the magnetic field at any point is **tangential** to the field lines
- This is a **dipole**, meaning it ALWAYS have a N-S pole.

## Interactions with the current
It was discovered that a current-carrying wire will also have a magnetic field. As the current increases, the magnetic field also increases in proportion. 
- Obeys the **right hand rule**

## In a solenoid
- Tightly-wrapped conducting wire, where length > diameter.
- $n$ of wraps go up to 15000
- A **uniform** field around the center

Inserting an object with a *ferro* core into it, we get an **electromagnet.** This increases the magnetic field even more. In all cases, the magnetic field is always **directly proportional** to $I$: 
$$B \propto I$$
For a solenoid, it will also be directly proportional to $n$, the number of coils: 
$$B\propto n$$
We get the equation for the magnetic field in the solenoid: 
$$B = \mu_0\frac{NI}{L}$$
## Of a moving charge
For $\hat r$ being the vector that points from the source charge $q$ to the **field point** $P$, we have the equation: 
$$\vec B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec v \times \hat r}{r^2}$$
The direction will generally follow the right hand rule, and negative charges will have the opposite direction.

> Point the thumb in the direction of $\vec v$ with your right hand, and the direction of curl is the direction of the magnetic field.

The constant $\mu_0$ is called the magnetic constant, and is roughly equal to $4\pi \times 10^{-7}$.
