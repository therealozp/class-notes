For an infinitesimal current $Id\vec l$, the magnetic field generated by this current can be defined as: 
$$d\vec B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}(\frac{Id\vec l \times \hat r}{r^2})$$
In the above equation, $\hat r$ is a unit vector from the current element to the **evaluation point**, and $\mu_0$ is the **magnetic permeability**. 

## Biot-Savart Law

The direction of the field due to the current element is indeed determined by the right-hand-rule. 

Only the horizontal components $dB_x$ remain: 
$$d\vec B_x = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}(\frac{NI\cos \theta ds}{(R^2 + x^2)})$$
Integrating the entire loop over $ds$ gives: 
$$\vec B(P) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int\frac{\vec I \times \hat r}{r^2}dl$$
Completing the integration, we should get the equation: 
$$B = 10^{-7}\cdot\frac{I}{r^2}dl\times \sin{\theta}$$
## Long, straight current-carrying wire
Doing the same integration process, we should get results for the magnetic field of a current carrying wire:

$$B_x = \frac{\mu_0}{2}\frac{NIR^2}{(R^2+x^2)^{3/2}}$$
As $x \rightarrow 0$: 
$$B_x = \frac{\mu_0}{2}\frac{NI}{R}$$
The equation for $x=0$ gives us the maximum field of the coil for a given current.

## Ampere's Law
Unlike Gauss' law, this one is not defined by magnetic flux, but rather by a line integral over the entire length $l$ of the wire: 
$$\int \vec B\cdot d\vec l = \mu_0 \cdot I_{encl}$$
where $I_{encl}$ is the net current enclosed by the path in question.
