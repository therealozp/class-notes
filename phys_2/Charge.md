## 1. Nature of Charge
Atoms, and charges contained therein, are the building blocks of matter. Generally, each atom have the same number of protons and electrons, which give them **a neutral charge**. Like charges **repel**, and unlike charges **attract**.

> Charge cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred.

Milkan discovered that **a single electron has a charge** of $-1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ Coulombs. 

Charge (unit C) can be calculated in one of two ways, either with **rate of flow** $I$ and **time** $t$ (s):
$$Q = I \cdot t$$
or with the number of electrons and the **integral multiple of electron charge**
$$Q = N \cdot 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}$$

## 2. Coulomb's Law: 
Given a source charge $Q$ and a net charge $q_0$ (in this case, $q_1$ and $q_2$), the **force** is proportional to the product of two charges and inversely proportional to the **distance**. The force can be calculated by: 
$$F_{1\ on\ 2} = F_{2\ on\ 1} = k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
Where $k$ is $9 \cdot 10^9$ $\frac{N\cdot m^2}{C^2}$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the **charges of these two particles** respectively.

Consider the same charges, but now, suppose that one charge is removed:

With a test charge of value $q_0$, we now see that A still **exerts an electric field** $\vec E$. An electric field is the **electric force** (at a given point) **per unit test charge.**

That value can be calculated using Coulomb's law: 
$$\vec E = \frac{\vec F_0}{q_0} = k\frac{|Q \cdot q_0|}{q_0\cdot r^2} = k\frac{|Q|}{r^2}$$

- The electric field of interest is generated by the **source charge**.
- $E$ generated by a point charge is *not* a constant field.
- The test charge interacts with $E$ at the location of the test charge -> we are only interested in the direction of the field **at the location of the test charge.**
- The source charge will always be at rest, and the test charge can **either** be fixed or **accelerate**.
