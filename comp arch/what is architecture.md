**application software**: written in high-level language
**system software**:
- *compiler* translates HL code to machine code
- *operating system* services the code
	- handling IO
	- managing memory and storage
	- scheduling tasks and sharing resources
**hardware**: processor, memory, IO controllers

> comp arch is the **abstraction/implementation** layer, that allows executions to happen. 
## the architecture circle
**application software**: written in high level languages, such as Python, C++, Java, etc.
**system software**:
- the **compiler** translates HL code to machine code
- **operating system** handles I/O, manages memory and storage, and schedules tasks and resources
**hardware**: processor, memory, IO controllers
## processor
**datapath**: performs operations on data
**control**: sequences datapath, memory
**cache**: small, fast SRAM for immediate data access
