comp arch is the **abstraction/implementation** layer, that allows us to:
- execute information
- process applications
- efficiently use manufacturing technologies
architecture provides feedback to guide application and tech research directions.
## the computer revolution
- progress in computer technology **is underpinned by Moore's law**
- makes novel applications feasible:
	- computers in automobiles
	- cellphones
	- search engine, www
$\to$ computers are pervasive
## classes of computers
- **personal computers**: general purpose, variety of software. subject to cost/performance tradeoff
- **servers**: 
	- network based
	- high capacity, performance, reliability
	- small servers to building-sized
- **supercomputers**: high-end scientific and engineering calculations. highest capability, smallest market share.
- **embedded**: hidden as components. extremely stringent power/performance/cost constraints.

first computer booted at Princeton 1952, design by John von Neumann
## the architecture circle
**application software**: written in high-level language
**system software**:
- *compiler* translates HL code to machine code
- *operating system* services the code
	- handling IO
	- managing memory and storage
	- scheduling tasks and sharing resources
**hardware**: processor, memory, IO controllers
## processor
**datapath**: performs operations on data
**control**: sequences datapath, memory
**cache**: small, fast SRAM for immediate data access
