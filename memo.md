Now that I have officially declared my hiatus for 6 months, I want to leave you with a framework that I believe will guide our project successfully in my absence. I urge you to reflect now, for you will see that the person who has been leading you over the past years has NOT been me, but rather, yourselves. This essence of collaboration that we've fostered should not only continue, but also flourish. Hence, before my departure, this shall be the legacy that I pass on to all of you: a survival guide.

**Your Role(s):**
By now, you should all be aware that each and everyone of you are able to lead not just yourselves, but everyone else if the need arises. Innovation and leadership are not confined to titles: your actions speak volumes.

With this in mind, I encourage each of you to embrace leadership roles, whether by guiding peers through challenges, innovating solutions, or supporting each other's growth. At the end of the day, this is your support system, and no matter the situation, always consider the possibility that someone else will know something that you don't. Strive to make those around you better as a result of your presence. Be a leader, not a boss.

**My expectations:**  
It would be unfair for me to ask too much of you when I am the disengaged one, but I have but one expectation for all of you: to maintain our environment of mutual respect, open communication, and keep pursuing the best no matter what you do. You are not only custodians of our current project but also pioneers shaping its future. Keep talking, be proactive in solving problems, and support each other in every possible way. By now, I am confident that each and every one of you have the ability to lead and solve their problems, so it is high time you put those skills to work!

**Some Guidelines:**  
- **Have some heart when reviewing code:** Understand the intent and challenges behind each contribution. Approach reviews not as a critique of personal ability but as a collective step towards improvement. For all the reviewees, understand that this is not reflective of your own ability! We are only doing this to hold each other accountable and better our collective work.
- **Ownership and Accountability:** Take responsibility for your work and its impact on the project. Own your successes and your mistakes. Learning is part of the journey. It's not like I will be there to punish you regardless, but I have it in good faith that everything will run like clockwork even when I am not there.
- **KEEP LEARNING:** Stay curious, embrace new technologies, and always be willing to share knowledge with your teammates. The growth of this project is intrinsically linked to your personal and professional growth.
- **Talk to each other:** Encourage diverse perspectives and leverage them to innovate. Our project thrives on collaboration, and every idea is a step towards groundbreaking solutions. Trust me when I say that it is always better to have a fresh set of eyes coming in to solve a problem!

Even when I am gone, remember that leadership and innovation are not confined to my role but are a testament to our collective capabilities. You are incredibly talented individuals, and I have full confidence in your ability to push this project to bigger and greater things.


I learned that I can be as relaxed or as crazy as I want to be, as spontaneous and as planned as I see fit. I realize that I am free to do as I wish. 

With this freedom, I often find it hard to relate what I want to do versus what I am supposed to do. What I have been doing is tiring because it is in conflict of what I want to do. Now, I want to be able to convince myself that I do what I like, and like what I do.
