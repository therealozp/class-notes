## continuous random variable
a random variable where the line such that the possible data can fall into a continuum. to describe a probability of some event happening from $a$ to $b$, we use the equation:
$$P(a \leq x \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$

## expected values
a weighted average of the values inside a measurement multiplied by its probability. can also be thought as "if we do an event $X$, what is our best guess of the result value?"

for a discrete rv:
$$E(X) = \sum x\times f_{X}(x)$$

for a continuous rv:
$$E(X) = \int x\times f_{X}(x)dx$$
## variance
measures how **varied** the output can be (or how dispersed it is) around the mean. 
> "how far does $X$ tend to be from the mean?"
> "how good is the mean as a guess?"
## chain rule (kinda)
	a function of a random variable **is a random variable**.11
