# hello notes
this is all my notes from various CS classes i have taken during college. this note workbook is best viewed with the app Obsidian, as it provides numerous tools such as page links, notes graphs, images, LaTeX, and more.

since GitHub does not support wikilinks the way Obsidian does, your experience may be extremely degraded. however, if you feel that there is a better way to link the images and LaTeX formulae, or find some errata within my notes, please submit a pull request and correct me!

thank you! i hope you find this useful. please give it a star if you do!
