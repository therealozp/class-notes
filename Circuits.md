## Current Model
An isolated conductor (when $E$ is zero): 
- Electrons drift randomly
- Metal atoms remain fixed
- Each atom contributes one shared electron

Electron flowing through a filament (bulb): 
- The potential will drop across a certain conductor, but it will not drop across the wire

## Current
For a charge $\Delta q$ moving through a wire segment in a time $\Delta t$, the current (rate of flow of charge) is simply: 
$$ I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$$
The SI unit of current is the Ampere (A or C/s).

We can also define current in terms of potential difference and resistance. Resistance is defined as "the degree to which a substance or device opposes the flow of current." All materials which **conduct electricity** have some degree of resistance. 

For a conductor made with a specific material, the equation for resistance is: 
$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$ Where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material, A is the cross-sectional area, and $l$ is the length of the conductor. 

### The conduction model
In the conduction model, we take the direction of the electric field as the direction of the current,
