## conglomerate mergers
suppose that Google extends itself to producing autonomous vehicles. even though this does not necessarily benefit from the economies of scale, there are certain financial reasons why a big conglomerate wants to extend out to a new product/service.
## economies of scale
the firm is enjoying a decreasing **long-run average cost** over the long run range of production. however, economies of scale is strictly a long-run phenomenon.

even though the $SRATC$ will also decrease on the short run graphs as well, this is not considered an economy of scale. the main reason is because in the short run, **capital is fixed**, and you are only working to increase output.

no capital constraint in the long run. 

you are not exiting the industry despite losing money in the short run, if you can later on use the correct amount of capital and produce at a profit. always look at the long-run cost structure before making a strategic decision.

the minimum efficient scale (MES) is the smallest amount of production we can go at to take advantage of all the economies of scale. to compete in the long run, a firm needs to have equal (or smaller) LRATC as their competitors. this does **not** necessarily mean that the firm needs to produce as much as their competitors, they just need to reach the MES.
