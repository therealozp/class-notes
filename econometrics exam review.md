RESET test: tests whether the relationship is only linear, or there exists some non-linear component. uses an auxiliary regression of the **fitted value squared** or cubed

estimator bias only occur when omitted variables or wrong functional form (tested with RESET)

log -> percentage, linear -> units

missing variables on one, available in other -> joint hypothesis test of missing variables (q7)
