## q1
a competitor of a firm (firm A) is any firm, in any product or geographic region, whose presence impinges upon firm A's ability to raise prices.

to "delineate" or "define" a market, we need to examine all firms in the market to see who would be the competitor of A, geographic-wise or product-wise. otherwise, they would not be considered in the "same market", and which could mean that their presence is not potent enough to impinge on A. 
## q2
the way we can examine whether A has competitors is by looking at A's price elasticity of demand:
- if $|E_{A}| > 1$, demand is elastic, so there has to be a rival out there if consumers are very willing to switch.
- if $|E_{A} < 1|$, demand is inelastic, so that indicates that even if there are other firms, consumers are not prone to switching.

to identify who are the rivals themselves, we check the **cross-price elasticity** of demand between two firms.
- $E_{AB} > 0$: substitutes
	- the larger the magnitude of this cross-price elasticity *if it is positive*, the more likely it should be included under the same market.
- $E_{AB} <$ complements

small but significant non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP test): perform a hypothetical monopoly test for market determination.
## q3
the geographic market for Bern's is however many miles people are willing to drive to get to Bern's. the product market is probably anything with some sort of fine-dining experiences. Burger King and Outback Steakhouse is probably not going to be in the same market.
## q4
a.

a HHI of 1 indicates an extremely concentrated market (a perfect monopoly). the larger the HHI, the more concentrated the market is. the lesser the HHI, the closer it is to perfect competition.

Lerner's index: the proportion of price - marginal costs, over price. 
$$L=\frac{P - MC}{P} = -\frac{HHI}{E}$$
if, at profit-maximizing price, the Lerner's index is tiny, then the firm is producing close to perfect competition. else, if the firm has a big Lerner's index, then the firm is producing at a very high price.

b.
there are markets where even though there is a lot of market concentration, but very little market power ($P$ is close to $MC$). this **only** appears when the threat of potential entrance is enough to beat out the price increase (called contestable markets).
