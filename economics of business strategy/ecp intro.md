 oligopoly means rival firms' profits are dependent on rivals' strategy.

early 1900: Edgeworth and Nash finalized a critical element:
- to maximize your profit, you need to predict how your rival will respond

business tactics vs strategy:
- **tactics**: *routine* business decisions or practices made to maximize profit under prevailing market conditions
	- setting MR = MC to produce optimally
	- price low on sensitive customers, price high on insensitive customers, etc.
- **strategy**: go beyond tactical decisions by attempting to **alter market conditions** and **competitors' behavior**.
	- to make better profit than just using tactics alone
	- to protect that profit against rival firms in the long run

the term "business strategy" was not used until early 1900s, because there were very few oligopolies until the late 1800 and 1900. 
- expansion of geographic markets led to the emergence of oligopoly markets with fierce competition
- price wars -> destructive competition that insured only the largest firm survives
- set up trusts, which were legal cartels, and let a few of them control output and prices 
	- public hates this 
	- Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust act
- M form corporations:
	- created monopolies and oligopolies in competitive industries
	- multidivisional orgs
	- vertically integrated
	- large amounts of capital 
	- extensive scale and scope economies
	- this interdependence led the C-suites to think about business strategy as a means of competition.
- John von Neumann and Oscar published the solutions for:
	- zero-sum games (military)
	- non-zero-sum (business)
- Nash published in 1950:
	- formulation of equilibrium that does not limit the number of players

1954: Peter Drucker publishes, and defines "business strategy": study of how business managers can consciously employ formal strategic moves to exert some positive control over market forces.

1. case study method (by Harvard)
2. industrial organization (by Micheal Porter)

Porter: managers too reliant on operational methodologies to streamline production + lower costs
- lower costs lead rival competitors to lower prices
- profits gone, no permanent gain
- adopting cutting edge tech is called operational effectiveness (OE)
- OE increases profitability in the short run, but not sustainable in the long run. so, OE is **not** a business strategy.

> a company can outperform rivals if and only if it can establish **a difference it can preserve**.

competitive strategy: "the essence of strategy is choosing to perform activities differently than rivals do"

e.g. Southwest, Ikea

but choosing a unique strategic position is not enough for sustainable advantage:
- competitors will imitate & reposition 
- managers must choose to design or offer, in such a way that deters/delays imitation by rivals

creates sustainable profits if the conditions are made:
- strategic positioning: lower costs/raise revenues by doing something different than competitors
- sustainable advantage: protect position from rivals who will copy the strategy
