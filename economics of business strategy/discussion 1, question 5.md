c.
The profit-maximizing price and quantity is 100 and 2500, respectively. So, the total revenue would be:
$$TR = 100 \times 2500 = 250000$$
with the constant long-run average costs and long-run marginal costs of 50, the total cost of producing at the optimal quantity is:
$$TC = 50 \times 2500 = 125000$$
and the total profit for the firm at this quantity is:
$$Profit = 250000 - 125000 = 125000$$

d. 
For a linear demand curve, total revenue is only ever maximized at the point where $MR=0$, or in this case, producing at $3750$ units at price $75$. We can see that the total revenue produced at this quantity is:
$$TR = 3750 \times 75 = 281250$$
so, producing at the profit-maximizing price **will not** maximize total revenue.

e.
The largest marginal profit that we can possibly get will always be the **first unit produced**, where $P - LAC$ is maximized. In this case, the maximum profit margin the firm is able to receive will be $150 - 50 = 100$.

So, in part c), we are not maximizing profit margin. To maximize profit margin, we are only producing 1 unit. At the optimal output level $Q^*$, our profit margin is $100 - 50 = 50$.
