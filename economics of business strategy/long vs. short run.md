when it comes to making decisions, we will not care about short run inputs (sunk costs and all) for us and our rivals. instead, we will only look at the type II, 1-lump indivisible type of fixed costs.

if a cost is sunk, then the economic cost of using an additional unit of input is 0.

## costs
**explicit costs**: the monetary payments to resource owners
**implicit costs**: the money that the owner forgoes for not investing it in other things, or the money lost by using the equipment instead of leasing it out. 

economic profit = total revenue - explicit costs - implicit costs
economic profit belongs to owner of the firm, so increase in economic profit makes owners richer. else, it decreases the owner's wealth.

accounting profit follows GAAP, which does **not** include implicit costs. so, AP will always be larger than EP.
