a. 
a strategic move is an action that a firm takes **before** its rival makes a decision. 
- strategic commitments **(unconditional)**. 
- strategic threat **(conditional)**. a threat is credible if, when the time comes to carry out the threat, it is in the threatening firm's best interest to follow through and carry out the threat. (might be damaging to the other firm)
- strategic promises **(conditional)**. only makes sense if it is profitable to *both firms* when it comes time to carry out the promise.


b. 

c.
- irreversible: it needs to be credible
- understandable: if the rival can't understand the commitment, they won't believe it
- visible: if they can't see it, they don't know what is going on

d.
sunk costs = irreversible. the irreversibility of the action sells the commitment. we won't reverse this decision despite reversing it is in our best interest.

## dq2
this basically is talking about strategic commitments. you need to have your rival believe that you are irreversibly committed (in this case, to destroying the world with nuclear bombs), and vice versa.

if they believe we are not going to carry out the threat, then they would make the first strike (and vice versa).

he developed a reputation for being aggressive by doing stupid price cuts that sacrifices AA's own profit. although it does not make economical sense, this was enough to make his threats credible, whereas the same threats made by other CEOs will never work out.
## dq4
a.
this statement is indeed a threat. however, this is **not** credible, because it is not in Motorola's best interest to choose analog after Sony goes digital (they make less money)

b.
this seems like a promise, because both firms will benefit from a higher profit should both choose analog. however, this is an empty promise, because Sony could easily choose digital and make more profit.

## dq6
"when rival firms operating at or near their productive capacity, price wars are much less likely to occur," this is true because we are already producing near our max, so we can't lower prices down by a substantial amount.
