a. 
a strategic move is an action that a firm takes **before** its rival makes a decision, that can be used to manipulate the rivals' decision to make more profit for yourself.

a strategic move needs to be credible. a threat is credible if, when the time comes to carry out the threat, it is in the threatening firm's best interest to follow through and carry out the threat. 

generally, three main types of strategic moves
- strategic commitments **(unconditional)**. 
- strategic threat **(conditional)**. might be damaging to the other firm. takes the form "if you take action A, i will take action B. action B will certainly be bad for you".
- strategic promises **(conditional)**. only makes sense if it is profitable to the promising firm when it comes time to carry out the promise. takes the form "if you take action A, i will take action B. action B will certainly be desirable for you".


b. 
it needs to be credible because a rival will ignore the strategic move if it is not credible. 

c.
- irreversible: it needs to be credible
- understandable: if the rival can't understand the commitment, they will not deem it credible
- visible: if they can't see it, they don't know what is going on

d.
sunk costs = irreversible. the irreversibility of the action sells the commitment. we won't reverse this decision despite reversing it is in our best interest.

## dq2
this basically is talking about strategic commitments. you need to have your rival believe that you are irreversibly committed (in this case, to destroying the world with nuclear bombs), and vice versa.

if they believe we are not going to carry out the threat, then they would make the first strike (and vice versa).

he developed a reputation for being aggressive by doing stupid price cuts that sacrifices AA's own profit. although it does not make economical sense, this was enough to make his threats credible, whereas the same threats made by other CEOs will never work out.
## dq4
a.
this statement is indeed a threat. however, this is **not** credible, because it is not in Motorola's best interest to choose analog after Sony goes digital (they make less money)

b.
this seems like a promise, because both firms will benefit from a higher profit should both choose analog. however, this is an empty promise, because Sony could easily choose digital and make more profit.

## dq5
a. cell a is the co-operative outcome

b. the non-cooperative outcome is D. cell D is also a Nash equilibrium (non-cooperative Nash). the reason Nash is non-cooperative is because it is making the best decision for ourselves - not the joint profit. 

c. cell B and C are cheating cells. this is where each firm makes the most individually across the board.

d. 
in a one-time game, both alpha and beta would really want to price high - but both will think that their rivals will think they will cheat. so, with this knowledge, both will cheat (price low). in this case, the cooperative outcome will never work out for a one-time game.

### trigger strategies
suppose that on the long-run, we are cooperating - and one firm decides to cheat. then, that triggers a punishment by reducing the price (cheating). 
- that means both price high forever, until one guy cheats by cutting their price.
- **tit-for-tat** involves following the pricing of the rival immediately before
- **Grim** involves cheating once means receiving the punishment forever

we will cover another strategy called **eye-for-an-eye**: if firm A gets cheated on for an X period of time, then they will retaliate for however long that is. then, they will go back to being cooperative.

the eye for an eye strategy might work out something like:

| alpha | High | High | H              | H   | H   | L (punishment) | L   |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- |
| beta  | high | high | *Low* (cheats) | *L* | L   | L              | L   |

e.
the undiscounted gain would be price difference between cell C (beta cheats) and cell A (cooperative), which is $200-300=100$.

24% per year = 2% per month, then for 2 months:
$$PV_{benefit}=\frac{100}{1.02}+\frac{100}{1.02^{2}}=194,000$$
f.
the undiscounted loss would be price difference between cell D (non-cooperative) and cell A (cooperative), which is $200-75=125$

however, note that in this case, the punishment would not take effect until the 3rd month, because of the eye-for-an-eye strategy. then, the present value must be discounted **for month 3 and 4.**
$$PV_{cost}=\frac{125}{1.02^{2}}+\frac{125}{1.02^{4}}=233,000$$

g. 
then, because the present value of the cost $PV_{cos t}$ outweighs the present value of the benefit $PV_{benefit}$, firm beta will not cheat.

h. 
changing to a 30% per month discount rate:
$$PV_{benefit}=\frac{100}{1.30}+\frac{100}{1.30^{2}}=136,000$$
$$PV_{cost}=\frac{125}{1.30^{2}}+\frac{125}{1.30^{4}}=101,000$$
so, in this case, beta will cheat.

## dq6
"when rival firms operating at or near their productive capacity, price wars are much less likely to occur," this is true because we are already producing near our max, so we can't lower prices down by a substantial amount.
