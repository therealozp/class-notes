## q2
a. the litmus test for whether doing something in-house gives you a competitive advantage, is that it is **cheaper to do it in house**, compared to if you would purchase it from a marketplace. always choose which one is cheaper: making it in house vs. from an external supplier.

b. focusing on the supplier profits rather than highlighting the actual costs that you undergo. 

c. producing in house or not, whenever we produce something in house and the price suddenly rises, the cost of flying the passengers will now also have the **opportunity costs** of not selling that same gallon. so, if you think about it, the total economic costs are always the same.

d. the issue with buying up all distributors to foreclose them, new distributors will arrive, because now there is virtually no barriers to entry.
that way, when you foreclose all distributors:
- firms that currently rely on the closed distributors will offer a very high price for the resource
- economy opens up and more distributors will come

## q3
gains and losses when hedging are irrelevant to the total cost of the firm themselves. whenever you own and asset, there will always be an opportunity cost of using the asset instead of selling it.

reasons to "buy": get this service externally, outsourcing, etc. from a **market firm**.
- patents and proprietary information
- the ability to aggregate demand: when going on the LRATC, the larger producers of the specific output will be better able to exploit the economies of scale in the manufacturing process. depends on negotiation and the amount of competition in the market.

eliminating and avoiding bureaucracy costs: when choosing to produce a good in-house, there might be some additional costs that the firm incurs:
	1. agency costs
	2. influence costs
	
a signal for when a company does well at moving production in-house is when they are able to flip it and sell it for a profit (market firm). if your firm is able to produce a good at the minimum long-run average costs (like other market firms), then your firm is as efficient as a market firm. so you're doing good!

## q4
agency costs might be substantial. agency costs arise from the principle-agent problem, where the managers don't really make decisions in the best interest of the owners.

a. 
- P-A problem: there is not enough incentive for managers to NOT do a lazy job - because the owners don't really know about it.
- because they don't produce a good as a main product, there is not as much pressure as market firms (who has to compete with others) to produce as efficiently as possible.
	
to solve this problem:
- transfer the product at the market price. too high -> no pressure, too low -> no profit.

## q5
a.
influence costs are resource wasted by firms by trying to influence internal decisions with capital and resources. two main types:
- the influence activity ends up misallocating resources. (suboptimal patterns)
- wasted time in all of the peddling
for example, at a university with a bunch of different colleges/departments, where department chairs have to constantly pester the university for more funding for their firm.

b. solution without outsourcing: instead of aligning compensation to the specific division, **tie it to the overall firm** instead. this way, all leads of a specific department will have an incentive to act in the best interest of the firm instead of their own department.

### why produce in house
fundamental contracting problems:
- reduce poor cost coordination across the vertical chain: big inputs processed step by step until final chain -> coordinates to not end up with silly bottlenecks. sometimes, while there is good reason to purchase from the market, it is worth it to reduce those kinds of bottlenecks.
- reduce cost of leaked private information
- reduce transaction costs (using marketing, searching for product for best price, learn qualities, etc.)
- RSA (relationship-specifc assets)
## q6
a. an RSA is some asset or investment that:
- supports a particular business deal, or some type of activity between two parties,
- has **very large** sunk costs. 
	for example, A buys a machine X for a transaction with party B. if B falls through, the X becomes sunk.
hold-up: holds up the contract until one party invests in the RSA, then backtracks. for example, wait until A buys X, then instead of hiring them for $1M, only say $500K.

four main types of specificity:
- site specificity: geographic location of the asset
- physical assets specificity: 
- dedicated assets specificity: made specifically for a particular buyer (a company). 
- human assets specificity: skills and training that makes a specific human capital especially viable for the specific company.

b. in this case, this would be a dedicated assets specificity. although technically, NutriSweet does make product for other producers, the majority of the investment is done to serve Pepsi and Coca-Cola. 

c. the boilers are going to be the physical asset RSA here, because it is specific to a certain source of coal that has a certain level of sulphur / moisture.

## q7

a. AS is offering Reading to build, and they will pay in return. in this case, Reading is investing in the RSA. this can either be the site-specific, or dedicated asset-specific. 

b. 
economic rent: the profit to a resource. the net gain between your income and your opportunity costs. 

once the railway gets set up, there are virtually no opportunity costs. so, the economic rent in this case is the total revenue ($6M - 0 = $6M). and clearly, this rent is to be earned by Reading.

c. 
quasi-rent: difference between the profit from the best use, and the profit from the next-best use. the quasi-rent is going to be the maximum amount that they will be held-up. 

every RSA has a quasi-rent. the larger the quasi-rent, the less likely there will be a partner to agree to the RSA. 

so, the quasi-rent in this case would be $6M - $2M = $4M.

d.
hold-up: holds up the contract until one party invests in the RSA, then backtracks. for example, wait until A buys X, then instead of hiring them for $1M, only say $500K. in this case, AS would hold up Reading for 6 million.
## q8
a. better able to coordinate with each other. for example, electric cars won't be shipped without  a battery - you would want cars and battery produced at a very similar rate.

b. reduces the leakage of private information of the new product (saves R&D costs).

## q9
a. the aggregation of demand
b. more likely to be able to aggregate demand for more specific products. more tailor-made PCBs and everything might require investment in RSAs, so it's generally more difficult.
