## part c
if $P_{B}=20$, then $P_{A}=13.5+0.1875\times 20=17.25$.
if $P_{A}=36$, then $P_{B}=31.5+0.125 \times 36=36$.
## part d
we expect that managers of firm A will set the price at $19.872$, rounded to 20; and managers of firm B will set the price of good B to $33.984$, rounded to 34. at this pair of prices, both firms are maximizing their own profit given what their opponent is doing.

$P_{A,nash}=20$
$P_{B,nash}=34$
## part e
the Nash quantity for firm A: $Q_{A,nash}=100-4P_{A,nash}+1.5P_{B, nash}=100-4\times 20 + 1.5 \times 34 =71$
the Nash quantity for firm B: $Q_{B,nash}=120-2P_{B,nash}+0.5P_{A, nash}=71=120 - 2 \times 34 + 0.5 \times 20=62$

then the profit of each firm is:
- firm A: $\Pi_{A}=(P_{A}-c_{A})\times Q_{A}=(20-2) \times 71=1278$ dollars
- firm B: $\Pi_{B}=(P_{B}-c_{B}) \times Q_{B}=(34-3) \times 62 = 1922$ dollars
## part f
if firm A and firm B sets price at $22$ and $35$, respectively, then the profit of each firm is:
- firm A: $\Pi_{A}=(P_{A}-c_{A})\times Q_{A}=(22-2) \times 71=1420$ dollars
- firm B: $\Pi_{B}=(P_{B}-c_{B}) \times Q_{B}=(35-3) \times 62 = 1984$ dollars

however, this pair of prices are **strategically unstable**. that is, at this pair, both firms can unilaterally change their decision, and both will make more profit.
- firm A, when seeing that firm B is pricing their good at $35$, can unilaterally deviate and **price down** to $P_{A}=13.5+0.1875 \times 35= 20.0625$ and make more profit.
- firm B, when seeing that firm A is pricing their good at $22$, can unilaterally change their decision and **price down** to $P_{B}=31.5+0.125 \times 22= 34.25$ and make more profit.
