## economies of scale
the firm is enjoying a decreasing **long-run average cost** over the long run range of production. however, economies of scale is strictly a long-run phenomenon.

even though the $SRATC$ will also decrease on the short run graphs as well, this is not considered an economy of scale. the main reason is because in the short run, **capital is fixed**, and you are only working to increase output.

no capital constraint in the long run. 

you are not exiting the industry despite losing money in the short run, because later on, you can adjust to the correct amount of capital and produce at a profit. always look at the long-run cost structure before making a strategic decision.

the minimum efficient scale (MES) is the smallest amount of production we can go at to take advantage of all scale economies. to compete in the long run, a firm needs to have **equal (or smaller) LRATC** as their competitors. this does **not** necessarily mean that the firm needs to produce as much as their competitors, they just need to reach the MES.

the MES is not necessarily the profit-maximizing point of production. "maximizing" means finding the intersection with the marginal point. it is just a **threshold to reach if you want to survive the long run** without a cost disadvantage.
#### how does this happen?
economies of scale generally happen due to three main reasons: 
- **most common**: the spreading of the indivisible, fixed costs over the increasing amount of output.
- specialization and division of labor
- technological factors, meshing of equipment or justifying more expensive technology


capital-intensive processes, when the process relies more heavily on machinery instead of labor or materials. so if a product requires a lot of capital to produce, it generally gets more efficient, because indivisible costs are more likely to get spread out.

honorable mentions:
- meshing of equipment, so that the capacity of machines are not wasted. 
	- a newspaper agency has a printing press of capacity 5k/day, and a folding machine of 3k a day.
	- if the agency only produces 5k a day, you would need 2 folding machines - and have a leftover capacity of 1k.
	- if it produces 30k, 6 PPs and 10 folding machines mesh perfectly.
- justifying the use of more expensive technology for production
## conglomerate mergers
suppose that Google extends itself to producing autonomous vehicles. even though this does not necessarily benefit from the economies of scale, there are certain financial reasons why a big conglomerate wants to extend out to a new product/service.
## learning economies of scale
LAC curve just shifts down as the cumulative Q rises. strategic rivalry might push managers to go rapidly along the learning curve to not compete at a cost disadvantage.

## economies of scope
two conditions for achieving economies of scope:
- shared inputs 
- if you are producing at the profit-maximizing point for X, the opportunity cost of using it for Y is **zero**. meaning, you don't have to sacrifice any of X's inputs to produce Y.

this is **different from** joint products: if you have enough inputs for one product, you automatically also get another product as a byproduct.

#### q3: diseconomies of scale
- management diseconomies
	- monitoring and controlling employees lower down the chain
	- management must delegate work
- specialized inputs spread too thinly: when producing too much things at the same time, the non-reproducible inputs for a certain good are spread across different other goods as well. so, without the specialized input, the **average cost rises**.
	- a brilliant chef who opens a restaurant decides to open up another one. not being able to manage both at the same time, because he has to spread himself over two restaurants.
#### q4:
$$LTC(Q_{m}) = 900,000+50\times 5000 = 1,150,000$$
a. 

b. these two are not joint products, because producing one does not produce the other as a byproduct.

c.
$$LTC(Q_{m}, Q_{b}) = 900000 + 50Q_{m} + 60Q_{b} + 25000$$
because the $900000$ is shared, and the additional $25000$ is accrued.

d.
$$\begin{align}
& 925,000 + 50\times 5000 + 40\times 6000 \\
& =925,000 + 250,000 + 240,000 \\
& =1,415,000
\end{align}$$
e. 
$$LTC(Q_{m}) = 900,000+50\times 5000 = 1,150,000$$
f. 
$$LTC(Q_{b}) = 900,000+50\times 5000 = 1,140,000$$
g. 
yes, because $LTC(Q_{m}, Q_{b}) < LTC(Q_{m}) + LTC(Q_{b})$.
#### q5
when there are economies of scope, usually the multiservice/multiproduct companies will survive. they are able to compete for much less, and their long-run total cost are the lowest. 

however, there is not a good framework to compute an average cost for multiservice firms.

if you can convince the consumer that you are of higher quality, then the single-service firm might still be survive. stuff like consumer perception, quality, etc. are not in the cost equations.
#### q6
spreading advertising/branding costs over a large number of different products.
#### q7
pecuniary (purchasing) economies of scale are when big firms get discount on larger amount of inputs. as you expand output, the input costs go down.

so, a valid strategy can be to expand production to take advantage of purchasing economies of scale can add to outputs.

the MES is **not** affected by the pecuniary economies of scale. however, due to the PES, we might even achieve an even lower long run average cost.
#### q8
R&D for improving products, having more products, or lower costs of production. either way, to make more profit. 

R&D expenditure produces uncertain benefits, in that you don't know what you exactly want. for example, pharma company researches anti-inflammatory, but accidentally produces a drug to reduce blood pressure. if a multiservice company happens to cover this, then we are getting a much better payoff.

if R&D is necessary, the market survivors are typically multi-service.
### q9
without the effects of a learning economy: the firm only sets to produce the optimal level of output based on demand.

because learning economies generally reduce costs, a firm is motivated to produce as much as possible to move further along the learning curve. so, charging a lower price now would sell more unit, which allows them to learn faster and lowers future costs. 
#### q10
a.
to check if a product can experience an economies of scale, the **average cost of production** should decrease as more outputs are produced. 

in this case, for product X: 
- when producing 50 units of X, costs an average of 2
- when producing 90 units of X, costs an average $\frac{210}{90} = 2.33$

for product Y:
- when producing 8 units of Y, $\frac{150}{8} = 17.5$
- when producing 10 units of Y, $\frac{320}{10}=32$

since average costs is increasing, there is no economies of scale for either X or Y.

b. 
to check if a firm benefits from economies of scope, add its constituents individually and compare to they are produced together.

in this case, 
- $LTC(8, 50) < LTC(8, 0) + LTC(0, 50),$ and 
- $LTC(10, 90) < LTC(10, 0) + LTC(0, 90)$ 
at both production levels, there are economies of scope. however, this might not always be true, where one level may indicate scope, and one level might not.

note: learning economies of scale means achieving a cumulative amount of product will lead to a decrease in average costs for all points beyond that threshold.
