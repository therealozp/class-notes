elasticity is essentially the **ratio of proportion**, which, in all other fields, measures **sensitivity**. then, the elasticity of demand measures how sensitive demand is to price.

typically, for elasticity $E$, if:
- $|E| > 1$ means demand is elastic 
- $|E| < 1$ means demand is inelastic 
- $|E| = 1$ means demand is unit elastic 

total **revenue** will always move in the direction of the dominant effect.

the elasticity of demand at a certain price $A$ can be calculated using the point elasticity formula:
$$E = \frac{P}{P-A}$$
where:
- $P$ is the **price intercept** of the inverse demand curve
- $A$ is the price at which we are calculating the elasticity
