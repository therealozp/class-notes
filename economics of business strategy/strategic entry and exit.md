entry and exits are **long run** decisions.

when a firm enters the market:
- the price set by the incumbent firm will go down, leading to lower profit
- quantity sold by the incumbent firm will go down

three main types of entry:
- de novo entry: a firm that has never been in the same market before (brand new firms). generally small firms, and tend not to be successful (i.e. Rivian in the car market)
- diversified entry: entry via new products (because a firm has created a product competitive to ours)
- geographic market entry: firms that originally start outside our market, but geographically enters into ours.

if enter: have to obtain capital to last the 10 year gap, or find a way to.
- risk: unknown, but predictable. we are able to describe the probabilities of some of the outcomes.
- uncertainty: we know **nothing**, and we can predict nothing. 
most of the time, firms have subjective probabilities - instead of not having anything at all.

a decision maker's tolerance is their choice to treat two different gambles.
- risk-averse if you choose to take the less risky option, given that both have equal expected values.
- risk-loving if we choose the more risky option.
- risk-neutral if you don't really care (indifferent) about which one, if they have the same expected value. for a risk-neutral decision maker, **only the expected value matters**.

we typically assume that a decision maker is risk-neutral, meaning they will always go for whichever decision yields the higher expected value.

it needs to be the case that our rival needs to **believe** that our strategy is permanent. for example, before a new firm enters, you would want to expand your output capacity, which shows entering firms that the incumbent firms already have the massive capacity to expand.

we will only be talking about risk-neutral decision makers for the most part. a risk neutral decision maker will only enter the market if the **expected stream of future profits** exceed the **expected cost of entry**.
$$PV_{\text{expected profits}}>\text{expected costs}$$
### time value of money
the **present value** of a future stream of profit/cost of entry is affected by the recurring profit, and the **discount rate**, which is how the firm expects the value of money to fall. 

given the profit $\Pi$, discount rate per period $r$, and number of periods (could be yearly, monthly) $n$, the present value can be computed as:
$$PV=\frac{E(\Pi_{1})}{1 + r} + \frac{E(\Pi_{2})}{(1 + r)^2} +\dots+\frac{E(\Pi_{n})}{(1 + r)^n}$$
where $E(x)$ is the expected value.

## dq 1
$E(\Pi)=0.25\times-2+0.5\times 2.5+0.25 \times 10=4.5\text{ mil.}$

so, the present value of future profits:
$$\frac{4.5}{1.08}+\frac{4.5}{1.08^{2}}+\dots + \frac{4.5}{1.08^{10}} \approx 30.2\text{ mil.}$$
costs breakdown:
- 2M license fee sunk
- 40M, half sunk -> 20M
- 3M training costs sunk
- 5M advertising sunk
total costs: 30M

since PV benefits > PV costs, Hipro should enter the market.

b. 
when adjusting for the 10% discount rate:
$$\frac{4.5}{1.10}+\frac{4.5}{1.10^{2}}+\dots + \frac{4.5}{1.10^{10}} \approx 27.7\text{ mil.}$$
now, PV benefits < costs, so they should not enter the market.
## dq 2
a. 
a **barrier to entry** is anything that makes it more profitable to be an incumbent firm. there are usually 2 types of barriers to entry:
- structural barriers: something underlying about demand or cost that deters new firm from entering. usually, this asymmetry is some type of sunk cost that incumbent firms have already incurred, but the entering firms have to go through. 
	- barriers created by the govt. in some form of license/patent laws
	- economies of scale
	- essential input barriers
	- consumer lock-in
	- brand loyalties
	- network externalities
- strategic barriers: comes from incumbent firms actively altering the way potential rivals view the profitability of entering. for example, limit pricing, capacity expansion, etc.

b. 
scale economies: incumbent firms in the market typically produce at the minimum efficient scale. when new firm enters:
- they clearly cannot enter at a small scale, because that is an extreme cost disadvantage -> they need to enter at a large scale.
- incumbent firms can keep prices low due to their low LAC, but they can still generate profit. entrants cannot reach this point without huge long-run losses!

c.
scope economies can cause asymmetry as well, because a multi-product firms already inherits some of the cost savings brought by shared R&D, common inputs, or advertising. that means that there will also be the same cost asymmetry for new firms to enter the market by producing a single input.

d.
consumer lock-in can create structural barriers, because of the nature of the product that makes a **high switching costs**. this can be:
- contracts (for phone companies)
- learning curves for new products (software or technologies)

e.
network externalities occur for one of two reasons:
- the usefulness of the product require connecting customers
	- dating apps, because they are more enjoyable to use when there is a lot of people using it
	- phone types, such as digital or analog phones that have different means of processing
- complimentary products are important to the consumer
	- Apple where their products make it easier for the consumer to use in the "ecosystem"
## dq3
a. the incumbent firms need to have either a **cost advantage, or a revenue advantage** (network externalities, consumer lock in). it needs to be the case where the entering firm **cannot** quickly overcome the asymmetry either.

the only way that the entering firm can overcome this asymmetry is entering on a large scale, and incurring a huge setup cost, **which are all sunk**. if these costs don't exist, then there are no barriers to entry/exit.

b.
- scale economies - entering on a cost disadvantage
- scope economies - new entrants face cost disadvantage
## dq4
### limit pricing
limit pricing is a strategy to **prevent entry**. it is usually cheaper to deter entry than to force a firm to exit later. so, limit pricing is **lowering your price** before a firm enters. you can still some economic profit, but *not maximum* profit. 

limit pricing is lower than the profit-maximizing price, but still higher than costs. because the original price is high enough, to the entering firm, a little cut due to price reduction is still good enough for economic profit. so, you can just limit price until the future stream of profit is small enough so that the cost can't be covered by the entering firm. 
### asymmetric situation 1: cost advantages
let's say Star Coffee is currently selling coffee at $4 a cup. suppose that another firm, Burnt Beans, wants to open in the same mall, and compete with Star. 

Star believes that $3 is the limit pricing, but she needs to commit to this price for a whole year. for example, Star asks the owner of the mall to create a contract that says "do not change price for the whole year", and tapes it to the wall for the owner of Burnt Beans to see.

the characteristics of limit pricing:
- higher than the incumbent firms' LRATC
- low enough so that the entering firms would have negative profit (profit cannot cover cost of entry)

if an incumbent firm **could** change their price after another firm enters, **they would**. note that the Nash price in the duopoly is higher than the limit price, so the incumbent firm could unilaterally change their prices and make more profit. 

limit pricing can only work if the incumbent firm can convince the entering firm that they can commit to charging the limit price post-entry.
### asymmetric situation 2: signaling theory
the entering firm might think that we have achieved some sort of cost breakthrough, so they would expect to enter at a cost disadvantage. so, the limit pricing **can** work. 

b. 
he concludes that cement producers effectively created a cartel, which means they are able to set prices much higher than MC. these firms could ship their cement to rivals' areas to compete if they wanted to, but they don't.

usually, when demand increases, the cartel price also increases. however, in this case, demand goes up, but cartel prices still stay the same! more evidence they are engaging in limit pricing.

## dq5
### predatory pricing
a force exit strategy. usually consists of 2 phases:
1. predation: the predator (firm that executes this strategy) cuts their price below their LAC. the predator would lose money in this phase.
2. recoupment: predator bumps price up again

the discussion in this case, is going to be how much we will lose in phase 1, and how much we can regain in phase 2. 

the longer the predation phase goes, the more percentage of the losses you will incur. predatory pricing will only ever hold in court if:
- there are barriers to entry to the market. 
- the losses incurred by the incumbent firm are large, and it is still able to recoup the lost profit.

b.
the **strategic** circumstances in which predatory pricing might succeed is through reputation.

suppose you decide to engage in a pointless predatory episode, despite knowing that these losses are unrecoverable. but, you are signaling to other rivals that you are **aggressive** and will engage in predation just to get all the market share. (Robert Crandal, American Airlines)

this is super costly, and definitely not cheap. and will take multiple episodes for this to work.
## dq6
the decision to enter is risky, and you have to decide that the present value of the expected stream of future profit is large enough to cover sunk costs. entering firms predict the post-entry competitions based on the pre-entry competition. if your competitors are aggressive, probably don't enter. if they are sticking comfortably at the Nash equilibrium, then there is a chance they might accommodate.

the ideal solution is sometimes, you would accommodate other entrants, to soften the blow and cover the profits loss by the increase of product amount in the market.
### capacity expansion
the threat of us expanding our production frontier, to produce more and lowering the price. expansion means adding capital to the firm, and get loads more output quickly and cheaply. in reality, we don't want to do this to hinder our profits - we only want to have this as a threat. 

so, this is an entry deterring strategy. we need to make this decision **before** the new firms enter. if you think that capacity expansion works, then you do it quick.
- you want the costs of this expansion to be **sunk**. this is to show the commitment to expanding capacity. selling your excess capacity is just accommodating. 
- the expansion needs to **lowers marginal costs** (meaning the profit-maximizing quantity will go up)

for example, in the same Star and BB competition. if Star decides to expand their shop with outdoor seating, then this expands their capacity and further drives price down because of the increase in quantity. however, this might just lower it enough to a point where BB does not see any profit entering.
