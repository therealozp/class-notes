the first assumption to do game theory is that both firms have **common knowledge**. this may or may not be true, as there are also situations where they are dealing with **asymmetric knowledge**. 

in this way, asymmetric knowledge changes the way the game is played.

## rules
1. if you have a dominant strategy, play it. in this case, the dominant strategy will always be whichever **one maximizes your own profit.**
2. assume the rival is strategically astute. meaning, if they also have a dominant strategy, they **will** play it.

if one of you have a dominant strategy (and know about your rivals'), the game is basically solved.

1. mark best decisions first. always mark everything, and show process. for each dominant payoff cell for each rival, mark which choice they will make.

## Nash equilibrium
a **Nash equilibrium** are cells where the firm makes the best possible decision (greatest possible profit) **given what their rival is doing**. it is not necessarily the greatest profit generator in of itself.

a pair of decisions where **both firms** make the best decisions for themselves individually given what their rival is doing.
## strategic stability
a strategically stable pair of decision is a decision where **not a single player** is able to **unilaterally** change their decision, and make more profit. a **unilateral change** from one firm is one firm moving, while the other does not. 

in other words, a strategically stable pair means, for each pair, if one guy moves, both will. 

functionally equivalent to doing a Nash equilibrium analysis. in a payoff table, if a cell is Nash, it is also (deductively) strategically stable.

## sequential game
propagate backwards. if after the first propagation, we can narrow down to our opponents' choices, we can pick the best decision for us between the two.

sequential moves will give specific advantages. to determine which, draw both game trees:
**S moves first**:

**Z moves first**:

then, the advantage table looks like:

| mover | 1st | 2nd |     |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| S     | 16  | 13  |     |
| Z     | 15  | 12  |     |
in this case, both S and Z want to move first, so they both have the first-mover advantage. if there should be a case where 1st and 2nd have equal payoffs, we have **no-mover** advantages.
