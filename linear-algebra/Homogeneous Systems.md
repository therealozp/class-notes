a homogeneous system is defined such that all constants are set to 0, or the last column of the augmented matrix is all 0's.
$$
\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}& \cdots & a_{1n} & 0 \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}& \cdots & a_{2n} & 0  \\ \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & 0  \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & a_{m3}& \cdots & a_{nm} & 0\end{bmatrix}
$$
when there is a homogeneous system, there are only 2 possible cases of solutions: 
1. There is always a trivial solution (all unknowns are 0's)
2. There are infinitely many solutions in addition to the trivial solution
