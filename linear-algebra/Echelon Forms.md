The linear systems of equation represented by an augmented matrix by reducing it to the **echelon form**: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 7 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
This is the **reduced row echelon form**, and must satisfy these properties: 
1. If there are rows that are all zeroes, they must be at the bottom of the matrix
2. The first entry must be a 1
3. In any 2 successive rows without all zeroes, then the leading 1 must be lower to the right than leading 1 of the previous row
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeroes everywhere else in that column. 

Note that this is also in RREF as it satisfies all these 4 rules: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
Another thing to remember is that the last row does not matter, so the leading 1 rule does not apply. So a matrix in RREF can look like this: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & * \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & * \end{bmatrix}$$
By contrast, these are the **row echelon form** : 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
In this example, the column that contains the leading 1 has non-zeroes in other column.

## Solving
The purpose of the RREF is to get a form so that is tantamount to the actual solution of the systems of equations. So, by having 1 in each column and 0's in all others, it is effectively representing
$$\begin{matrix} x_{1} & & &= * \\ & x_{2} & &=* \\ & & x_{3} & =*  \end{matrix}$$
## Parametric equations
When a system has infinitely many solutions, such as this: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & -4 & 7 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
we will define the solutions $x,\ y,\ z$ by using an additional parameter $t$. First, rewrite all solutions at with respect to $z$: 
$$\begin{split} x = 1 -3z \\ y = 7 + 4z \\ z = z\end{split}$$
By setting this to $t$, we get a **parameter** by which we get infinite solutions.
