the categorizing **process of sequences** of tokens based on orderings.

a language's syntax are the parsing rules to categorize sequences of tokens. **syntactic analysis** is the parsing phase of the compiler.

```
tokens stream --(parser)--> tokens in categories --(parser actions)--> AST
```

anywhere in the parsing process, a **stack** will be involved.
