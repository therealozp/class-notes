Recall some of the inequalities and their meanings: 
$x \geq a$ means $x > a$ **or** $x = a$
$a \leq x \leq b$ means $a \leq x$ **and** $x \leq b$

Therefore, the negation of $x  \geq a$ is $x < a$, and vice versa. 

For example, if we were to negate $-2 \leq x < 5$ and $0 \leq x \leq 7$, we would get something along the lines of:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\lnot ((p \land q) \land (r \land s)) & \equiv \lnot (p \land q) \lor \lnot(r \land s) \\
									 & \equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q \lor \lnot r \lor \lnot s
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$
Which means around $x < 0$ or $x \geq 5$.
