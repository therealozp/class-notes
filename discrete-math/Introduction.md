## 1. Arguments
---
An **argument** is a sequence of [[Statements]]. The last statement is the **conclusion**, everything before that are premises. 
- If an argument has a **valid form**, then if *all premises are true*, then *the conclusion is true.*
- An argument is **sound** if each premise is true, and the **conclusion** is also true.
--> A **valid argument** is any valid argument, whether it is **sound**  or not.
--> An **invalid** argument or a **valid argument made unsoundly** tells us nothing. 

## 2. Modus Ponens
---
**If P, then Q.**  $P \therefore Q$ 

> "If **you** are in this class, then **you** are a USF student."

- This is a **sound** argument, because the form is valid, and each premise is true. 
- If this is said to a student outside this class, then **it is no longer sound.**
--> **Unsound** and **invalid** arguments are meaningless in this case. 

Arguments which appear to use a valid form, but have **issues with interpretation or ambiguity** are considered **invalid.**

> "If you work hard in this course, you will get an A. "
- Invalid until defined clearly what *work hard* means
