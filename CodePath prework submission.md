Imagine youâ€™re in a breakout room and a student asks you for help on a coding question you do not know the answer to. What specifically might you do to nurture, model, and help demonstrate best practices, in this moment?

- read through everything
- starting small 
- adding items
- developing the logic
	- eliminate

**In a breakout room, you observe that students are on camera and on mic, but are working independently on problems and are not using the UMPIRE method. You attempt to get them collaborating and verbalizing, but they are resistant to your feedback.**

- trying to defuse 

Hi Liz,
i am Khang, and i am currently in a TIP102 session on X-day, and i am encountering an issue with group --, specifically x-student. I have notice --behavior-- from X-student, and I would appreciate you looking into this matter on what the next steps have to be.


dictionary organized -> slow to leaf through page -> instead

dead middle -> super find m -> dont have to look in the left half!
-> T -> in the left half! 

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
	low = 0
	high = len(array) - 1
	while low <= high:
		mid = (low + high) // 2
		if array[mid] == target:
			return mid, target
		elif array[mid] > target: # inside right half
			low = mid + 1
		else:
			high = mid - 1

	return -1
```
