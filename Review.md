Equations to remember: 
$$\Delta KE = -q_0 \cdot \Delta V = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$

For any $V_a$ and $V_e$ where $V_a$ > $V_e$, and the electric field is going in the direction of decreasing potential: 
- If a positive charge is moving in the direction of $E$, it accelerates. E.g. $$\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 > \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
- If a positive charge is moving **against** the direction of $E$, it slows down. E.g. $$\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 < \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
- If a **negative** charge is moving **in** the direction of $E$, it slows down.
- Else, it accelerates.

$$F_x = ma_x = q_0 E_x$$
$$a_x = \frac{q_0E_x}{m}$$
$$v_{fx}^2 = v_{ix}^2 + 2a_x\Delta x$$
Consider a ring of charge; at that point, the voltage (calculated for each infinitesimal $dq$) would be: 
$$V = \frac{kQ}{(R^2 + x^2)^\frac{1}{2}}$$
