## Business Cycles
They are the alternating **increases and decreases** in economic activity. They can: 
- vary in intensity and duration
- show a long-term upward trend
- have 4 phases: peak, recession, trough, recovery.

The NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) dates the US' business cycle, looking for **turning points** (where peak switches to recession, and where trough switches to recovery). These points are established by a consensus of **eminent economists.**

A recession often begins after two consecutive quarters of growth, and can be measured with: 
- **National Activity Index** (Chicago Fed): weighted average of 85 indicators, when index < -0.7
- **Leading Economic Index**: measures 10 leading indicators, when falling 3 months in a row

### Bonds
Bonds are the financial instrument used by most governments use to borrow. Investors buy bonds issued by the govt. in exchange for a financial return, called **bond yield**.
- US Treasury bills: short term govt. debt
- US Treasury bonds: long term govt. debt (10 years)
Bonds with **longer maturity** have a **higher yield**, but since it is over a long period of time, it is also **more at risk**.

The yield curve shows the interest rates for bonds with different maturity rates. Logarithmic shaped.
The **treasury spread** also indicates a recession, when short-term rates exceed long-term rates.

### Measuring the Economy
The economy can be measured 2 ways: 
- Adding up all **income produced** 
- Adding up all the spending.

**Blue line**: Product market produces goods -> household uses and becomes input ->  resource market -> becomes inputs for business -> producing good for the market
**Red line**: Households spend money -> product market -> revenue for businesses -> pays for resources market -> pays households (through salary?)

### GDP
*Gross Domestic Product* (GDP) measures the **total market value** of all **final goods and services** produced by **resources in a country** in a given year.
*Gross National Product* (GNP) is the total market value of all goods and services produced **domestically and abroad** using resources supplied by a country's citizens.

Why final goods? To prevent double counting. For example, the value of 2 apples used to produce an apple pie should not be counted twice.

Example: Brooks running shoes, made in China. So, since Brooks is a US brand, it counts toward **US GNP**, but counted towards **China's GDP.**

**Not** included in GDP: 
- Household work: cooking, cleaning etc.
- Informal economy
	- Legal: gig job not reported
	- Illegal: contraband, etc.

Adjustments to GDP: 
- Substituting payroll costs for the value of govt. services
- Imputing rental value of owner-occupied housing

### Measuring GDP
- Expenditure approach: measures total spending, including consumption, investment, govt. spending, and **net exports**
- Income approach: measures income to various factors of production
### Expenditure approach
The expenditure approach can be calculated using the formula: 
$$Y = C + I + G + (X - M)$$
where: 
- $C$ is **personal consumption** expenditures. They include purchases of durable goods (phones, clothes, furniture) and non-durable goods (food) and services.
- $I$ is the **gross private domestic investment**. it is highly volatile and causes swings in the business cycle.
	- investment in structures (residential and businesses)
	- equipment and software purchases
	- changes in business inventory
*Note*: products which are not sold in the produced year will count as that year's GDP, through **business inventory.** For example, shoes produced in 2013 but sold in 2014 will count for 2013 GDP.

- $G$ is **govt. spending,** which includes wages, purchases of goods and services from private businesses, and purchases of new structures and equipment. 
	- does **not** include transfer payments from the government (soc. security benefits, medicare, etc.)
- $X$ is the value in exports
- $M$ is the value of imports
### Income approach
GDP can also be calculated as compensation to factors of production: salary, proprietors' income, corporate profits, rental income, net interest, taxes on production and imports, adjustment to national income, etc.

## Nominal vs Real GDP
Nominal GDP is what is described above. Real GDP takes prices into account, as it accurately reflects the output of the country.

| Trend            | Nominal                                          | Real                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| When prices rise | It will also go up although not more is produced | Will stay constant unless more goods are produced |
| Increases        | Price up / Output capacity unclear               | Output does go up, better standards of living     |

Purchasing power parity: takes cost of living between countries into consideration to adjust GDP measures.
Population: GDP per capita takes into account differences in the sizes of countries by dividing GDP by population.
