Economic growth contributes to factors that improve the standard of living: 
- Reduced poverty rates
- Improved health and life expectancies - a positive association with higher GDP countries and longer lifespan
- Greater investment in education and technology

**Real GDP**: total output in a year measured in constant-year prices
**Real GDP per capita**: Real GDP divided by population (to even out the differences between two countries)

## Measuring growth
The BEA provides quarterly reports on changes in US GDP. They reflect these 2 rates: 
- **Annualized:** quarterly change in GDP is multiplied by 4, highlighting seasonal fluctuations and growth. 
- **Year-over-year:** a comparison of GDP of current quarter vs previous year. Provides trend growth for the entire year.

To calculate year over year, we can do: 
$$\% R = (\frac{R_f}{R_i} - 1) \times 100\%$$
### Compounding
Allow small growth rates to turn substantial over time. We have the formula: 
$$F=P(1+g)^t$$
Where $F$ is the final value, $P$ is the initial value, $g$ is the growth rate, and $t$ is the number of periods.

### Rule of 70
Used to estimate the number of years for a value to double: 70 / annual growth rate

## Growth
**Short run growth** occurs when an economy makes use of existing but underutilized resources. Common during recovery from recession. Characterized by **moving** a point **towards the PPF line**.

**Long run growth** occurs when economy finds new resources or find ways to use existing resources better. Characterized by moving the **entire PPF line outwards**.

## Factors of Production
- **Land and natural resources (N)** include land and raw resources from the land. 
- **Labor (L)** is mental and physical talents. **Human capital (H)** includes improvements to labor from training and education
- **Physical capital (K)** is manufactured items used to produce goods and service. 
- **Entrepreneurships and ideas (A)**: the ability to use resources to provide goods and services. 

A production function measures how an economy **turns inputs into outputs** using existing **technology**. 

The classical form of the production function determines output as a function of labor and capital: 
$$Output = f(L, K)$$
By incorporating all the factors of production into the function: 
$$Output = A \times f(L, K, H, N)$$
According to the above definition, *technology* drives output. 
### Improving the factors
- Improved land or discoveries of resources (oil or natural gas)
- Investment in human capital improves quality of labor, leading to higher growth rates

- Productivity measures how effectively inputs are converted into outputs, and is the key driver of **wages and incomes**. 
- **Labor productivity** is the ratio of output to the labor hours used to produce it.
- Increasing productivity can result from several factors.

### Capital-to-labor ratio
Measures the amount of physical capital available per worker $\frac{K}{L}$. A higher ratio means more labor productivity.

Is subject to **diminishing returns**: each additional unit of capital increases output by a positive but smaller amount.

### The catch-up effect
- Describes why developing countries may **initially grow faster** than developed countries.
- Developing countries can use **existing technologies** to make inputs **more productive**, while developed countries must continue innovating. 
- Also subject to **diminishing returns to capital.**

Total factor productivity $A$ measures the portion of output that is not explained by the amounts of inputs used. 
$$Output = A \times f(L, K, H, N)$$
In this case, it just happens to be technology, and it captures external factors that affects the overall effectiveness of inputs.

However, they can be whole range of things: 
- New discoveries and **innovations** 
- Natural disasters (a multiplier of < 1)
- Changes in a countries institutions

## Role of govt.
A government can influence the economic growth in a country by: 
- **contributing** to **physical** capital, **human capital**, and **technology**
- **enforcing contracts** (legal system), protecting **property rights** (patents and copyrights), and maintaining a **stable financial system**
- **promoting free** and **competitive markets**, open to **international trade**

Maintaining an appropriate barrier of entry to business allows for new businesses to enter and develop. 

Countries with higher **economic freedom** have a higher average per capita GDP.
