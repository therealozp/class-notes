## Aggregate Demand
The AD curve shows the **output of goods and service** (real GDP) demanded at **different price levels** (GDP deflator).
$$Q = C + I + G + NX$$
A higher aggregate price causes lower aggregate output. It has a **downward** slope because of the **wealth** effect, the **export price** effect, and the **interest rate** effect.

### Wealth effect ($C$)
Suppose the price level, $P$, increases. Then: 
- it decreases the real value of money (because lower purchasing power)
- Consumers are less wealthy
- Decrease in consumer spending ($C$) $\rightarrow$ decreases quantity demanded.

> As prices rise, purchasing power of wealth falls, reducing consumption. (C)
### Export Price effect ($NX$)
Suppose the **U.S.** price level increases. Then: 
- Domestically produced goods are more expensive. 
- US net exports fall, because: 
	- exports fall
	- imports rise (because foreign goods are relatively less expensive)
$\rightarrow$ decrease quantity demanded.

> As prices rise, exports fall and imports rise, reducing net exports. (NX)
### Interest rate effect
Suppose the price level, $P$, increases
- Buying goods and services requires **more dollars.**
- Need to hold more dollars to buy G&S
	- **Increase in the interest rate** (the cost of borrowing money)
	- Sell bonds, withdraw CDs and other assets
- Decrease spending on **investment** goods $\rightarrow$ decrease in $Q$.

> As prices rise, people hold more money, pushing interest rates higher, reducing business investment. (I)

### AD Determinants
A change in any of these components **(other than the $P$ effect)** will **shift** the AD curve.
 - consumption (C): consumer confidence, debt, tax cuts/hikes, stock market boom/crash
 - investment (I): when businesses have better expected rates of returns, business expectations, investment tax credits, interest rates, monetary policy
 - govt. spending (G): determined by federal, state, and local lawmakers
 - net exports (NX): foreign income, speculative exchange rate appreciation/depreciation (dollar **depreciates** $\rightarrow$ AD curve shifts **right**)

An increase in any of these factors will shift the AD curve to the right. A factor that shifts aggregate demand to the right will increase output at every price level. 

Examples: 
State govts. replace sales taxes with new taxes on interest, dividend, and capital gains. 
$\rightarrow$ $C$ will rise, because sales tax is gone, but possibility that $I$ will fall because more tax on interests.

## Aggregate Supply
The AS curve shows the **real GDP** that firms will produce at **varying price levels.**

### Long run (LRAS)
In the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical (i.e. out put doesn't change when price changes. )

![[Pasted image 20231020120509.png]]

In the long run, the economy will gravitate toward **full employment**, which depend on the factors of **production and technology.** **Improvements** to these two aspects will shift the LRAS **right.**

This incorporates the classical approach, which assumes all variables are adjustable in the long run.

### Determinants of the LRAS
The LRAS curve depends on the **economy's capacity.** So, the following factors can shift the curve: 
- Discovery of new resources
- Labor force quality improvements
- Improvements in tech and automation
- Intl trade and investment

The LRAS curve corresponds to output at full employment and takes time to change. 

### Short run (SRAS)
The SRAS curve is positively sloped because input costs are **sticky** (slow to change). 

When prices rise but input costs are sticky, profits increase and firms produce more, resulting in a short run increase in aggregate output.

### Determinants of SRAS
- changes in input price
- tech and productivity
- taxes and regulation
- market power (more market power $\rightarrow$ less output)
- inflationary expectations

A factor that shifts SRAS to the right will increase AO at every price level. For example: lower Inflation, productivity improvements, less taxes, etc.

Conversely, higher inflation expectations, input prices, taxes, and less competition will shift the SRAS to the **left**.

## Macroeconomic equilibrium
SRME occurs when the AD and SRAS curve intersect. LRME occurs where the AD and LRAS curve intersect. 

Whenever we are in LRME, we are **also in SRME**, but the converse is **not true.**

### The spending multiplier
Any initial spending is snowballed. 
- Suppose that $100 is spent on a 2-hr massage.
- $60 is spent by the masseuse on a paint class ($40 saved)
- $36 is spent on the restaurant (saved $24)
- ...

And thus, we can see that for every dollar earned, 60% get spent; and this adds up in the economy. 

To get the spending multiplier: 
$$ M = \frac{1}{1 - MPC}$$
where MPC is the **marginal propensity to consume** (in this case, 0.6) Through this calculation, we get $M = 2.5$. So, $100 spent will result in $250 aggregate output. 

### Interactions with the AD - AS
When the SRE is below full employment, spending multiplier magnifies new spending, shifting AD towards the LRE. An initial stimulus of $100 will generate an increase of $Q_1 - Q_0 = 250$

### Demand-pull inflation
A positive demand shock expands the economy beyond full employment output. 

However, rising input prices will eventually pull the SRAS to the left, back to the LRAS **at a higher price level**

![[Pasted image 20231020123554.png]]

We call this the **demand-pull** inflation. 

### Cost-push inflation
A negative supply shock **reduces output** and **raise prices**. 

The government could increase AD, and push the output back to full employment but **at higher prices.**

![[Pasted image 20231020124013.png]]

Alternatively, decreasing AD will **reduce inflation** but creates **more unemployment.**

## Long-run growth and inflation
Over the long run: 
- tech progress shifts LRAS to the right
- growth in money supply shifts **AD** to the right
$\rightarrow$ ongoing inflation and growth in output.

## Goodies
All else equal, rising income in **other countries** will **increase** US AD, but a rising value of the dollar will **decrease** AD.

For AS: steeper = more flexible prices, flatter = more rigid
