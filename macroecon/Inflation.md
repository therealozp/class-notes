Is measured against a market basket. Some price rises and some fall, but in general the price increases. 

Causes: 
1. **Demand factors**: consumer confidence, income, wealth
2. **Supply shocks**: price fluctuations on times such as food and oil
3. **Govt. policy**: its ability to borrow and print money. If govts. print too much money, then inflation increases.

**Disinflation**: a *reduction in the rate of inflation*. Prices rise at a decreasing rate.
**Deflation**: prices actually fall. 
## Consumer Price Index
Measures the average changes in prices paid by urban consumers (CPI-U) and urban wage earners (CPI-W) for a market basket of goods and services.

> CPI is a ***cost-of-goods index***: it compares the costs of a fix bundle of goods and services from one period to the next. 

1. Choose a fixed basket. 
2. Find the prices
3. Calculate the cost of basket
4. Choose base year, compute CPI
$$CPI = \frac{cost \ in \ current \ period}{cost \ in \ base \ year} \times 100$$
5. Calculate percentage change in CPI: 
$$R = (\frac{CPI_{curr}}{CPI_{prev}} - 1) \times 100$$
$R$ is the rate of inflation. 

### Problems
- Only measures **private goods**
- Tends to overstate inflation because it uses a **fixed market basket**
	- Does not account for *product substitution, quality improvements, and new products*
	- 3-5 years old
- Only measures consumers' out-of-pocket health care expenditures, **not** overall rise in healthcare costs.

## Measuring Inflation
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) issues updates on inflation: 
- **Consumer Price Index** (CPI) measures retail price level
- **Producer Price Index** (PPI) measures wholesale prices
- **GDP deflator** measures average price of all items in GDP.

## Impacts
### Beneficiaries
Debtors benefit from unanticipated inflation, because the **real value** of fixed payments **falls** over time as wages **rise** with inflation
### Harmed
- People living on fixed incomes -> decreasing purchasing power
- Creditors / lenders see the **real value fall**
### Unaffected
- Workers whose wages have escalator clauses (auto adjusted for inflation)
- Social Security recipients whose benefits are adjusted with inflation
- Banks that properly anticipate inflation. 

## Adjusting for Inflation
- **Price index** are used to modify payments to account for inflation
	- Used to *convert nominal values to real values*. Real values = Nominal value $\times$ (Base year index $\div$ Current year index ) 
- **Escalator clauses** are designed to adjust payments or wages for changes in price level e.g. commercial rental agreements, labor union contracts, SS payments, etc.

### Correcting variables
- Comparing dollar figures from different times
Inflation makes it harder to compare dollar amounts. E.g. minimum wage: 
1963 min wage = 1.25$
2013 min wage = 7.25$
Base year = 1984
CPI 1963 = 30.9
CPI 2013 = 234.5

After using the formula for adjustment, we find that 1.25 dollar in 1963 is worth $4.05 in 1984, while 7.25 dollar is only $3.09.

## Hyperinflation
Extremely high rate of inflation (at least 100% per year). Makes prices hard to interpret and track. (Zimbabwe) 
- Caused by excessive govt. spending over tax revenues and the printing of money to finance deficits
- Workers are paid frequently, and purchases are paid immediately
- The monetary system breaks down and a barter system comes into use

## Unemployment
Two types of surveys: 
- Establishment surveys (payroll) interviews **companies and establishments** for the headcount
- Household surveys interviews **household members** for job status. Normally less accurate.

- **Frictional unemployment**: temporarily leaves to look for newer jobs, or for newly graduated students
- **Structural unemployment**: caused by a change in roles
- **Cyclical unemploymen**t: resulting from business **cycles** (hence the name)

Natural unemployment rate: where inflation rate is same as expectations (no pressure on wages). Calculated with **frictional + structural**
