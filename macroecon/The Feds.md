## Creating money
Banks act as a bridge between savers and borrowers. A bank's ability to make loans (*to create money*) is limited to a certain percentage to its customer deposits.

Banks must hold a percentage of their total deposits as **reserves**.
- **Reserve ratio**: level of reserve a bank holds as a percentage of total deposits
- **Reserve requirement**: minimum required level of reserves a bank must hold as cash, or a fed deposit.

**Fractional reserve banking system**: when bank receives a deposit, a portion of it is held in reserve. The rest is lent out, which begins money creation. Banks create money by **lending excess reserves.** 

Suppose $1000 is deposit in bank A, and deposit requirement is 20%. Then, the balance sheet (T-account) looks like the following:

Suppose that the $800 that is lent out ends up in another bank, and that bank will then lend out 80%.

 And then this process continues and goes on. Each time new deposits are made from the original $1000, money is created. The total amount created from Banks A, B, and C:

If the process keeps on continuing to $n$ banks, the $1000 in original deposit turns into $5000. Hence, we get **the money multiplier**: 

The **money multiplier** measures the maximum amount the money supply can increase when new deposits entre the system:
$$M = \frac{1}{R}$$
where M is the multiplier, and R is the **reserve requirement**.

## Money Leakages
A leakage is the departure of money from the lending cycle, either because of an action taken by a bank, an individual, a business, or a foreign entity. These cause the **actual** money multiplier to be less than its theoretical amount. 

Causes: 
1. Banks that choose to hold excess reserves
2. Individuals and businesses that **hold money in cash**
3. Cash that is held by **foreign customers, businesses, and govts.**

Adjust the formula for the money multiplier for leakages: 1 / (Reserve requirement + Excess reserves + Cash holdings)
