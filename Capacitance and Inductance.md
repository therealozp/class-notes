## Inductance
The emf inducted in a circuit usually follows the formula: 
$$\epsilon = -L\frac{di}{dt}$$
From this, we can derive the inductance for a coil system of $n$-windings: 
$$L=\frac{N\Phi_B}{i}$$
where $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux through the coils. 

### Stored Energy and Energy Density
For an inductor with inductance $L$ with **a stable** current $I$ running through it, we can get the formula for total stored energy: 
$$U=\frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
and the energy density of a magnetic field B: 
$$u=\frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\ \ (in \ a \ vacuum)$$
for any other environment with magnetic permeability of $\mu$, substitute $\mu_0$ for that instead.

In a circuit containing a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and a source of emf, the growth and decay of current are exponential, by a time constant $\tau$. This is to say that when a switch is open and closed, current will not rush to become it's maximum value, but grow with time.
