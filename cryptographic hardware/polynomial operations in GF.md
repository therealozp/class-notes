## addition
equivalent to XOR

## multiplication
given $f(x) = x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^{2}+x+1$, find $f(x) \times g(x)$
1. do the multiplication normally (algebraically). in this case, distribute the terms to get: 
$$f(x)\times g(x) = (x + 1)(x^{2}+x+1) =x^{3}+x^{2}+x^{2}+x+x+1$$
2. cross out whatever the repeated term is. in this case, this is $x^{2}$ and $x$
$$x^{3}+\not x^{2}+\not x^{2}+\not x+\not x+1=x^{3}+1$$
