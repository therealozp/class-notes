to resolve issues with setup time violations, reduce the frequency of the circuit
for hold time violations, add a buffer in between (to add more delay)

interpolate + add data to db later

going from a Omap and D map + learn to generate the fprint through filter
- does the seed image matter? (test this), different seed, same image
- pass the original image (fprint) as a seed, and theoretically, with the correct density map and orientation map, the final fingerprint should not change
