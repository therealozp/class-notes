the long run is essentially when the duration of production is long enough such that all fixed costs can be come variable. to study these costs, we use the **isoquant**:
- a curve showing all possible input combinations capable of producing the same level output
- are downwards sloping, greater amounts of labor = less capital required
- **isoquant map** is a graph showing a group of isoquants.

## marginal rate of technical substitution
the MRTS is the slope of the isoquant at a given point, equals change capital over labor.
$$MRTS=-\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L}$$
because the slope of the isoquant is negative, we need to add a negative sign to convert them back.

the MRTS is also the ratio between **the marginal product of labor** and the **marginal product of capital**:
$$MRTS=\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}$$
## isocost curves
the isocost curve shows different combinations of inputs purchasable given a level of expenditure $C$ and input prices $w, r$
$$C=wL+rK\Rightarrow K= \frac{\bar{C}}{r} - \frac{w}{r}L $$
rewritten as a linear function, we get $\frac{C}{r}$ being the intercept, with the slope of $-\frac{w}{r}$.

## optimal level of input
the optimal inputs are when the **isoquant is tangent to the isocost**, meaning that *marginal product per dollar spent on the last unit of input* is the same.
$$MRTS=\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\frac{w}{r}$$
based on the optimal points we have derived on the isoquant and isocost map, we can derive an **expansion path**, which is all points where the input combinations for each level is output is **minimized**.

along the expansion path, the **input-price ratio is constant**, and equal to the MRTS.


## long-run costs
the long-run total cost (LTC) for an output is determined by:
$$LTC=wL^{*} + rK^*$$
where $w, r$ are prices of labor and capital, and $L^{*}$ and $K^*$ is the input combination that minimizes cost.

the average cost measures cost per unit output:
$$LAC=\frac{LTC}{Q}$$
where:
- falling LAC indicates **economies of scale**, or when firms are able to take advantage of opportunities through specialization, division of labor, and one-time setup costs
- rising LAC indicates **diseconomies of scale**, where firms are unable to manage and organize effectively. monitoring and controlling costs lead to rising unit costs.

special case occurs in **constant costs**, where neither economies/diseconomies of scale occur. here, the **LAC is flat** and **equal to LMC** at all inputs.

the long-run marginal costs measures the rate of change in total cost versus inputs:
$$LMC=\frac{\Delta LTC}{\Delta Q}$$
- both LAC and LMC are U-shaped
- LMC **lies below** LAC when LAC is falling (economies of scale)
- LMC **lies above** LAC when LAC is rising (diseconomies of scale)
- at the point where LAC is minimized, LAC = LMC

the **minimum efficient scale** (MES) is the **lowest level of output** where the LAC reaches minimum.
